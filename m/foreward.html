    <h1> Foreword by Jon Zens </h1>
    

    <p>It has been such an encouragement to my heart in the past
      fifteen years to see one book after another critique the status quo,
      challenge assumed traditions, and present a fresh vision for a
      functioning Body of Christ on earth. The Bride of Christ is such a
      beautiful and multifaceted organism that the nuances and insights that
      each author brings to the table can never exhaust the riches Christ
      has deposited in his Ekklesia on earth.
    </p>


    <p>This book is another wonderful, refreshing addition
      to the collection of writings in our generation that will help
      believers practice Christ-centered assembly life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The institutional model of "church" is etched so
      deeply in the fabric of our beings that we have forgotten
      that Christ’s glorious Ekklesia is a "Bride" – a living
      organism. Wouldn’t you be miffed if someone referred to
      your wife as an "institution"? To connect “institution” with
      a beautiful woman is totally inappropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>This Is My Body</i> does a superb job of confirming
      from various angles that the traditional institutional ways
      of doing “church” have little, and often nothing to do with
      the organic dynamics displayed in the New Testament.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the bureaucratic tunnel we call
      “church,” Keith notes that <i>“in our churches today, we
        have relied too heavily on ourselves, our own leaders,
        and our own ideas of doing church. I believe that every
        Christian ... must ask themselves this question: ‘Are we
        truly relying on God for our health and existence or are
        we relying on other people or things?’”</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>This Is My Body</i> provides solid evidence that the
      Ekklesia that Jesus has been building is really radically
      different from what people call “church.” This book sets
      forth contours from the New Testament of a better way to
      live out the life of Jesus together.
    </p>
    <p>
      May the Lord honor the voices in our generation
      that are calling believers to practice a Christ-centered,
      Spirit-led expression of organic Ekklesia!
