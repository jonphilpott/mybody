    <h1>Tertullian's Window</h1>
<p>
If you’d like to know what it was like to attend a
Christian gathering in the early days of the faith, here’s a
great look at what they were doing in the 2nd Century
according to Tertullian, a second century Christian:
</p>


<p class="bible">
“We are a society with a common religious feeling,
unity of discipline, a common bond of hope. We
meet in gatherings and congregations to approach
God in prayer, massing our forces to surround
Him...We meet to read the divine Scriptures...Our
presidents are elders of proved character.
</p>


<p class="bible">
“Even if there is a treasury of a sort, it is not made
up of money paid in initiation fees, as if religion
were a matter of contract. Every man once a
month brings some modest contribution – or
whatever he wishes, and only if he does wish, and
if he can; for nobody is compelled; it is a voluntary
offering...to feed the poor and to bury them, for
boys and girls who lack property and parents, and
then for slaves grown old.
</p>


<p class="bible">
“So we, who are united in mind and soul, have no
hesitation about sharing property. All is common
among us – except our wives. At that point we
dissolve our partnership.
</p>


<p class="bible">
“Our dinner shows its idea in its name; it is called
by the Greek name for love (Agape)...We do not
take our places at table until we have first
partaken of prayer to God. Only so much is eaten
as satisfies hunger. After water for the hands
come the lights, and then each, from what he
knows of the Holy Scriptures, or from his own
heart, is called before the rest to sing to God.
</p>


<p class="bible">
”Prayer in like manner ends the banquet...” <a class="fn" href="footnotes.html#section-1-11-10">10</a>
