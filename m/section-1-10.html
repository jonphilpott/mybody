      <h1>A First Century Pagan Talks to a First Century Christian</h1>
      <p>
        Imagine the conversation between an unbelieving
        Pagan in the first century and a follower of The Way:
      </p>


      <p>
        Pagan: "I would like to know more about this
        Christ you speak of. Where is your temple?"
        Christian: "We don't have one."
      </p>


      <p>
        Pagan: "What? Then where does one go to meet
        with your God?"
      </p>


      <p>
        Christian: "We are all the Temple of the Holy
        Spirit, so God meets with us wherever we are."
      </p>


      <p>
        Pagan: "Hmm...then where do you conduct your
        sacrifices?"
      </p>


      <p>
        Christian: "We have no animal sacrifice at all.
        Jesus became our sacrifice so that we could be
        free. Our only sacrifices are our own lives as we
        surrender to Him and His will every day."
      </p>

      <p>
        Pagan: "Fascinating! I would love to meet your
        Priest to learn more about this."
      </p>


      <p>
        Christian: "Well, I am a Priest."
      </p>


      <p>
        Pagan: "You are?! But I thought you sold pottery in
        the marketplace? How can you be a Priest in this
        new religion?"
      </p>


      <p>
        Christian: "You can be one also if you submit your
        life to Christ and place your trust in Him. We are
        all Priests of God."
      </p>


      <p>
        Wasn't it a radically different system of faith that
        Jesus gave His life to create? Why has the Church today
        become an institutionalized religion when it began as
        something so utterly unique and different that it captured
        the imagination of the common people and stood apart
        from the man-made religions of the day?
      </p>


      <p>
        According to Paul in Ephesians, the Church was
        created by God to communicate and model something
        radically different from the systems of this world.
      </p>


      <p class="bible">
        “His (God’s) intent was that now, through the
        church, the manifold wisdom of God should be
        made known to the rulers and authorities in the
        heavenly realms, according to his eternal purpose
        which he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.”
        (Eph. 3:10-11)
      </p>


      <p>
        The Church was part of God’s plan to reveal the
        mystery of God to the world. That included a variety of
        areas where the Church would look and behave
        differently than others around them.
      </p>


      <p>
        The Church was to be a place where there were
        no divisions of race, sex, or social status. When Paul
        says, <span class="quote">“There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free,
          male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus”</span> (Gal.
        3:28) this is part of what he is trying to communicate. The
        Church isn’t meant to look or act or behave like the world.
        It was designed by God to be different and to reflect a
        Heavenly design, not an earthly, man-made quality.
      </p>


      <p>
        So, when we take God’s organic design based on
        a family of equals and trade that for a man-made design
        patterned after the business world, we are denying our
        God-inspired DNA and dismantling our intended purpose
        to reflect the “manifold wisdom of God” by setting
        ourselves apart from the world.
      </p>


      <h2>The Character of the New Testament Church</h2>


      <p>
        The New Testament church did not collect money
        to be spent on salaries, programs, buildings or itself.
      </p>


      <p>
        The New Testament church was primarily
        concerned with making disciples and caring for the poor,
        the orphan and the widow.
      </p>


      <p>
        The New Testament church did not elect a
        separate “clergy class” to perform special religious
        duties. Instead everyone was “in the ministry” and
        empowered to serve and love as the Spirit willed.

      </p>

      <p>
        The New Testament church did not attempt to
        follow an Old Testament code of worship.

      </p>

      <p>
        The New Testament church affirmed the
        priesthood of the believer and allowed every member to
        share, participate and take an active part in the regular
        functioning of the church itself. These activities included
        baptism, sharing communion, preaching the Gospel and
        making disciples.

      </p>

      <p>
        The New Testament church did not keep a bank
        account. Instead it gave away all the funds laid at the
        Apostles’ feet in order to plant churches and care for
        those in need – both within and without the church body.

      </p>

      <p>
        The New Testament church leaders were humble
        servants who waited on tables, washed feet, served
        others, laid hands on the sick, and encouraged the
        persecuted. They understood that true greatness was
        found at the feet of others, rather than at the top of the
        ladder.

      </p>

      <p>
        The New Testament church did not segregate
        themselves based on age, sex, race, music preference,
        ethnic background, or any other criteria. Everyone who
        named the name of Christ, regardless of age, sex or
        race, was immediately a fully functional and valued
        member of the Body of Christ.

      </p>

      <p>
        The New Testament church did not verbally,
        politically or physically oppose the oppressive Roman
        government or pagan religions of the day. Instead they
        simply lived extravagant lives of love among their
        neighbors and served anyone in their path as Jesus
        commanded.

      </p>

      <p>
        The New Testament church was not in favor of
        violence, nor did it participate in armed conflict, not even
        in self-defense. Instead, the early followers of Jesus
        quietly imitated their Lord and gave up their property,
        submitted to prison and went to their deaths peacefully.

      </p>

      <p>
        The New Testament church allowed every
        member - male or female, slave or free, Jew or Gentile-
        to preach the Gospel, plant churches, teach the Word,
        and lead worship every single day.

      </p>

      <p>
        The New Testament church had no one single
        location where “Church” was located. Worship was not
        seen as something that happened in a particular location
        or on a particular day or with the assistance of particular
        people. Instead, worship was seen as a life continually
        submitted to Christ as a living sacrifice for the good of
        others, to the glory of God. The idea of a “worship
        service” is completely foreign to the New Testament.

      </p>

      <p>
        The New Testament church understood the
        Gospel of the Kingdom to be about God’s Kingdom (rule
        and reign) being released in the heart of every follower of
        Jesus. It was not something that would come one day
        after the death of the saints or the return of Christ.

      </p>

      <p>
        The New Testament church did not consider the
        work of the Holy Spirit to be weird or strange. Instead
        they accepted the moving of the Holy Spirit within the
        Body as the natural and continual ministry of Jesus being
        released in the Body. To heal, teach, instruct, correct,
        rebuke, inspire, encourage and empower the people of
        God was to carry the Gospel of the Kingdom and live a
        life of love for the sake of others.
      </p>


      <p>
        The New Testament church was always being
        taught to love one another and to imitate the love of
        Christ and to humbly serve others as Jesus did. They
        were not concerned in any way with amassing wealth,
        gaining status in the community, becoming politically
        powerful, being respected, changing laws, picketing the
        funerals of homosexuals, or speaking out against pagan
        practices. They were not interested in selling products
        with their church name, cross, or scripture verse
        attached.
      </p>


      <p>
        The New Testament church did not have a name.
      </p>


      <p>
        The New Testament church did not brand itself. The New
        Testament church did not provide a salary or ongoing
        stipend to those within the Body who functioned as
        Elders, Overseers, Shepherds, Teachers, or Facilitators.
        The people who performed these functions within the
        Body did so out of love and were only compensated by
        the Holy Spirit with joy.
      </p>


      <p>
        The New Testament church did not have a pulpit
        from which sermons were spoken by ordained clergy.
      </p>


      <p>
        The New Testament church did not have a Bible,
        or even a copy of the entire Old Testament, yet this Body
        managed to preserve the teachings of Jesus, the
        doctrines of the faith, the creeds and Gospel of the
        Kingdom with only the empowering presence of the Holy
        Spirit, and the teaching of the Apostles to guide them.
      </p>


      <p>
        The New Testament church did not market itself or
        the Gospel. Instead the original followers of Jesus
        concentrated on loving as Jesus loved, giving and
        sharing as Jesus did, and concerned itself with the
        welfare of others in need; both inside and outside the
        Body.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the world needs anything today, it desperately
        needs a return of the New Testament form of Church and
        a New Testament brand of Christianity.
