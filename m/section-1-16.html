      <h1>Practicising Christianity</h1>
      
      <p>
        According to the New Testament, the Christian
        faith was inaugurated at Pentecost when the Holy Spirit,
        in fulfillment of Joel 2:28-32, was poured out on all flesh.
        From that day forward, the followers of Jesus became
        empowered to preach the Gospel, baptize new believers,
        plant churches, and share communion with other
        believers. Every follower was in the ministry of Jesus
        Christ. There was no distinction between clergy and laity
        because in their minds, every follower of Jesus was
        <span class="quote">“...being built into a spiritual house to be a holy
          priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
          through Jesus Christ."</span> (1 Peter 2:5)
      </p>


      <p>
        When the Spirit of Almighty God was poured out
        on all flesh at Pentecost, those first Christians got it. They
        understood that the same Holy Spirit of God that once
        rested over the ark of the covenant behind a 300 pound
        veil in the Temple of Jerusalem was now living within
        their own hearts. They were excited beyond belief and
        consumed with a fire and a passion to share this living
        presence of God with everyone they knew.
      </p>


      <p>
        The original Christian church was one “not made
        with human hands”. Rather than following “the pattern of
        this world” the Biblical Christian church was birthed by
        the Spirit of God, empowered by the words of Christ, and
        under submission to the Father. Simply put, the Christian
        church we read about in the New Testament was
        something that God was doing, not men. In contrast to
        our Church today, the first Christians were ordained by
        the Holy Spirit of God Himself and sent out to proclaim
        the Gospel, the Good News, that the Kingdom of God
        had come to every man, woman and child.
      </p>


      <p>
        The artificial, man-made hierarchy we see in the
        Christian church today is not what the Church practiced
        under the Apostles in the New Testament. Unfortunately,
        over time, the Christian church surrendered the Spirit-
        filled approach where everyone contributed for a more
        top-down approach. Of course, as we’ve already seen,
        Jesus hoped to inspire a movement where men and
        women were all empowered by the Holy Spirit to be
        functioning priests in the Body.
      </p>


      <p>
        I believe this is partly why Jesus strategically
        chose his disciples from among the most common and
        ordinary strata of society. He wanted to make sure that
        when a run-of-the-mill fisherman stood up and
        proclaimed the Gospel no one would bow down and
        worship him. Instead, the people saw ordinary men and
        women just like themselves - uneducated, dirty, and
        painfully normal people - who had been caught up into
        the eternal purpose of God.
      </p>


      <p>
        When Peter spoke under the power of the Holy
        Spirit, or when Paul prayed for people to be healed, or
        when any of those unnamed disciples ministered to one
        another in the Body, everyone knew it was God doing the
        work, not the people themselves.
      </p>


      <p class="bible">
        “When they saw the courage of Peter and John
        and realized that they were unschooled, ordinary
        men, they were astonished and they took note that
        these men had been with Jesus.” (Acts 4:13)
      </p>



      <p>
        When they gathered together it wasn’t to hear
        words of “eloquence or superior wisdom” but to
        experience Jesus in their midst as the Head of the Body
        and to share Him through a communion that went beyond
        bread and wine. The original, New Testament Christians
        were empowered, <span class="quote">“not with wise and persuasive words,
          but with a demonstration of the Spirit's power”</span> (1 Cor.
        2:1-5)
      </p>


      <p>
        The Church is what God is doing, not what we are
        doing. We are living stones, but only because we are
        filled with the Life of Christ by the power of the Holy
        Spirit. Gathering apart from that is just a gathering. When
        we come together, to the Living Stone, we also like living
        stones are built up into a holy priesthood, offering
        sacrifices of praise to celebrate our Risen Lord who is
        present with us in the meeting.
      </p>


      <p>
        Can you imagine being in a room with Jesus and
        allowing someone other than Him to speak for over an
        hour? Can you imagine experiencing the awesome
        presence of the Spirit of the Living God and reading
        announcements? Clearly, if we actually believed that
        Jesus was in our midst when we came together as a
        church, our response would be radically different than
        what we’ve come to expect as normative Christianity.
      </p>


      <p>
        The Body of Christ is an expression of the
        tangible, resurrected Christ. Have we settled for less?
        Have we become comfortable listening to the wisdom of
        men rather than waiting quietly for the whisper of our
        Eternal Creator?
      </p>


      <p>
        The more I read the New Testament the more I
        see a people who were caught up in something beyond
        themselves. They were the most common, uneducated,
        normal people you can imagine. Even their leaders were
        humble, ordinary, everyday men and women who saw
        themselves as fortunate participants in the fulfillment of
        Biblical prophecy and the heart’s desire of Almighty God
        to reveal Himself to the World.
