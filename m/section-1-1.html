    <h1>Ekklesia as God Intended</h1>
    
<p>
Whenever we engage in dialog about the New
Testament form of church it is inevitable that someone
will suggest that there is no New Testament model for
what the church is supposed to look like. I want to affirm
to you that nothing could be further from the truth.
</p>


<p>
My very purpose for writing this book is to make
clear that God most certainly does have a specific design
for His New Testament Church. Furthermore, I believe
that it is essential for us, as followers of Christ, to do our
best to understand this design. Why? Because the
design is not arbitrary or accidental in nature. God’s
design for His Church is embedded in the very fabric and
spiritual DNA of the Gospel itself.
</p>


<p>
At face value, I think we should acknowledge that
the very idea that God has no strong opinion about how
His Church should operate or function is contrary to His
character.
</p>


<p>
Did God remain aloof when it came to the design
of the Tabernacle? Was He indifferent to how the Temple
was to be constructed? On the contrary, God was
meticulous and specific concerning his design for both
the Tabernacle and the Temple under the Old Covenant.
Why, then, should we assume that He suddenly has 
no intention or design for His New Testament Church?
</p>


<p>
Furthermore, we must agree that it would be more
than a little odd for God to take the time to inspire the
entire New Testament – which chronicles the birth and
formation of the Church – and not also reveal to us
anything about what that Church should look like, or how
it should function, or what form it should take.
</p>

<p>
What I am speaking of here are not merely my
opinions. These are clearly revealed facts documented in
both the Old and New Testaments, under the inspiration
of the Holy Spirit, concerning God’s ultimate plan for His
people – the Body of Christ.
</p>

<p>
My hope is that everyone who claims to follow
Christ would take seriously these very specific and
clearly communicated designs that God Himself has
revealed to us by His Spirit and in His Word.
</p>

<p>
More than this, my prayer is that we would not
only see what God has to say about His design for His
Church, but that we would also be willing to explore all
that He has for us to experience in this new pattern.
