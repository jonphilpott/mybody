      <h1>God's Relational Church</h1>


      <p class="bible">
        " The purpose of the Christian meeting was to hold
        the common meal, and to make it a memorial of Jesus’
        Last Supper with the disciples . . . The exercise of the
        spiritual gifts was thus the characteristic element in
        primitive worship. Those gifts might vary in their nature
        and degree according to the capacity of each individual,
        but they were bestowed on all and room was allowed in
        the service for the participation of all who were present.
        Every member was expected to contribute something of
        his own to the common worship . . . . Worship in those
        first days was independent of all forms."- Ernest F. Scott <a class="fn" href="footnotes.html#section-1-17-14">14</a>

      </p>



      <p>
        It is not God's plan for us to be alone. He has
        designed His Church to operate as a Family, and as a
        Body, where each part depends upon the others.
      </p>


      <p>
        Whenever Satan wants to attack one of us, he
        always starts by isolating us from the rest of the Body of
        Christ. Our Enemy knows that if he can separate us from
        the Body, he can cut off our source of strength,
        encouragement, love, and the rest of those God
        designed us to be in fellowship with. It's very true: United
        we stand. Divided we fall.
      </p>



      <p class="bible">
        "Let us not give up meeting together, as some are
        in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one
        another—and all the more as you see the Day
        approaching." (Hebrews 10:25)

      </p>



      <h2> WE NEED EACH OTHER </h2>

      <p>
        God has purposely designed His Church to be
        interdependent and connected at the molecular level.
        We've each been given different gifts for the purpose of
        helping one another to grow to maturity in Christ. Each of
        us has a spiritual gift (yes, even you) and it only works
        when we use it for the benefit of others within the Body.
        The early church did not resemble what we experience
        today. The weekly gathering was in a home, meals were
        shared, everyone contributed and there was no visible
        leader in the group who did all the talking or teaching
        while the rest of them listened.
      </p>


      <p>
        According to 1 Corinthians 12, God has designed
        His Church to act relationally. He has given everything
        the Body needs to function and grow to the members of
        the Body itself, "for the common good". The Body is able
        to thrive through the power and indwelling of the Holy
        Spirit, which lives within each member of this Body.
        If you read 1 Corinthians 12 and elsewhere in the
        New Testament, you will not see any teaching or practice
        within the Body of Christ where all of the gifts flow from
        one elect leader to everyone else so that they can grow,
        mature, receive mercy, etc. What God did do was to give
        all of the gifts to various people distributed throughout the
        Body.
      </p>


      <p>
        In God's relational design for His Church, the
        encouragement you need is available from someone else
        in the Body. This means you need the rest of us. It
        means we need you. We need each other to grow and
        mature.
      </p>


      <p>
        Couldn't God have given each person the spiritual
        gift they needed, when they needed it? Yes, of course He
        could have. But then we wouldn't need to relate to one
        another.
      </p>


      <p>
        Instead, God's plan was to place the gift you need
        most in the hands of someone else so that you and I are
        required to communicate our needs with one another. It
        is necessary for the life and health of the Body that we
        share our weakness and that we share the gifts we have
        been given.
      </p>


      <p>
        "Just as each of us has one body with many
        members, and these members do not all have the
        same function, so in Christ we who are many form
        one body, and each member belongs to all the
        others." (Rom.12: 4-5)
      </p>


      <p>
        We belong to one another. We need each other.
        We cannot survive alone.
      </p>


      <h2>WHOSE WILL BE DONE?</h2>

      <p>
        I've counseled several people over the years who
        have been wounded by someone in the Body, or fallen
        into a pattern of sin, or given in to depression. In each
        case they often feel that they must retreat from the Body
        in order to heal, or to think, or to "take a break" from
        Church.
      </p>


      <p>
        Whenever we do this we are allowing ourselves to
        play into Satan's hand. Our enemy knows that if he can
        isolate us from the rest of the Body (which was designed
        by God to strengthen us and build us up in our faith), he
        has already won the battle.
      </p>


      <p>
        We need one another. We were designed by God
        to love and to help and to serve and strengthen one
        another. If we remove ourselves from fellowship I have to
        ask, "Whose will is being done?" Certainly not God's will.
        If you find yourself in a place where you're drawing
        away from the rest of the Body of Christ, you need to
        remember that you belong to Jesus and it's time to return
        to fellowship in obedience to His Love for you.
      </p>


      <h2>KNOWING AND BEING KNOWN</h2>

      <p>
        Sometimes people in the Body of Christ will hop
        around from place to place and church to church, visiting
        here one week and there the next week. By doing this
        they avoid accountability and embrace anonymity which
        is just as dangerous as staying home completely.
      </p>


      <p>
        Again, God designed the Body to be relational. If
        we refuse to allow others to know us, if we avoid intimacy
        in the Body of Christ, we are denying our own spiritual
        DNA as members of God's Family. When we embrace
        anonymity we are opening the door for the enemy to
        draw us away from God and His people.
      </p>


      <p>
        A good friend of mine shared that his house
        church family was actively learning to see everything as
        an opportunity to learn how to love God and love others,
        or how to receive love from God and receive love from
        others.
      </p>


      <p>
        God designed His Church, (that's you and I), to
        operate best when we are sharing openly and loving one
        another intimately. We can't do that if no one knows us –
        our pain, our doubts, our hopes, our fears, our dreams,
        our joys, our sadness, our tears. We have to learn to love
        others, and to be loved by others, and by God, in all that
        we do.
      </p>


      <p>
        In our modern day traditional American church we
        have abandoned a relational, family structure and
        embraced a corporate, business model for the Church.
        We have shifted to an organizational model and not an
        organism model.
        In the words of author and theologian W. Carl
        Ketcherside,
      </p>


      <p class="bible">
        “We are not left to test and experiment with other
        forms and ideas. God has established a system
        which is the climax of all his creative genius. The
        inferior priesthood of the past pointed toward this
        sublime age of universal priesthood. We are not to
        go back to the literal and limited ministry of the
        previous dispensation, but we are to implement
        and utilize the spiritual and comprehensive
        priesthood made possible by the one who first
        became both sacrifice and priest. God's plan will
        work for us, if we will work his plan for him.” <a class="fn" href="footnotes.html#section-1-17-15">15</a>
      </p>


      <p>
        Do models matter? Yes, they do. If you attempted
        to run your family like a business it would change the
        dynamic of your family. Decisions would be made to
        benefit the business first and the concept of family would
        become lost in the new corporate structure of your home.
      </p>


      <p>
        God's design for His Church is important. If we are
        dying for community it's because we've abandoned a
        relational form of Church. If we see our pastors burn out
        and fall away it's because we've twisted God's relational
        plan for His Church into a one-man show. If our churches
        are unfriendly and cold it's because we have forsaken a
        family approach and embraced a corporate structure.-
      </p>


      <p>
        If we're really interested in following God's Word,
        it's important for us to listen to what it says, and to put
        these things into practice.
