      <h1>The Light Removes the Shadow</h1>

      <p>
        Have you ever wondered at the apparent
        difference between the way God behaved in the Old
        Testament and the way Jesus reveals Him in the
        Gospels? Perhaps you yourself have struggled with this
        apparent contradiction of character. Is there a logical
        explanation for why God seems to be so bloodthirsty and
        vengeful in the Old Testament scriptures, and yet so
        loving and gentle in the New Testament?</p>
      <p>
        Well, this debate is as old as Christianity itself. In
        fact, the very first person to point out this difference was
        Jesus himself.</p>
      <p>
        In the Gospel of Matthew, chapter 5, Jesus quotes
        the Old Covenant and then makes a new proclamation
        that demonstrates the differences between the two.
        First, he points out the differences in the Old
        Covenant command “Thou Shalt Not Kill” found in the
        Law of Moses and provides a radical new command
        under the New Covenant:</p>
      <p class="bible">
        "You have heard that it was said to the people
        long ago, 'Do not murder, and anyone who
        murders will be subject to judgment.' But I tell you
        that anyone who is angry with his brother will be
        subject to judgment” (Matt 5:22-23)</p>

      <p>
        Here at the start of his sermon on the mount,
        Jesus lays out for everyone a new covenant perspective
        which permeates the Good News of the Kingdom he has
        come to proclaim.</p>

      <p>
        In the past, God operated under the Old Covenant
        rule which was expressed through the Law of Moses, or
        the Ten Commandments. Now, according to Jesus,
        things will be different. As we enter the Kingdom of God,
        we can now expect something new. Instead of "Do not
        murder", Jesus ups the ante with "Don't be angry."</p>

      <p>
        Throughout this section of scripture, Jesus
        continues to contrast specific commands of the Old
        Covenant with new standards found in the New Covenant
        of Grace. Having addressed the command about murder,
        next he addresses “Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery”:</p>

      <p class="bible">
        "You have heard that it was said, 'Do not commit
        adultery.' But I tell you that anyone who looks at a
        woman lustfully has already committed adultery
        with her in his heart." (Matt 5:27-28)
      </p>
      <p class="bible">
        “It has been said, ‘Anyone who divorces his wife
        must give her a certificate of divorce.’ But I tell you
        that anyone who divorces his wife, except for
        marital unfaithfulness, causes her to become an
        adulteress, and anyone who marries the divorced
        woman commits adultery.” (Matt 5:31-32)
      </p>


      <p>
        Next he addresses the commands against bearing
        false witness or swearing oaths:
      </p>

      <p class="bible">
        "Again, you have heard that it was said to the
        people long ago, 'Do not break your oath, but keep
        the oaths you have made to the Lord.' But I tell
        you, Do not swear at all..." (Matt 5:33-34)
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, he addresses the Law in the Old Covenant
        concerning murder and retribution:
      </p>

      <p class="bible">
        "Jesus said, "You've heard it said, 'An eye for an
        eye and a tooth for a tooth', but I say to you, do
        not resist and evil man, and whoever shall strike
        you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also."
        (Matt 5:38-39)</p>

      <p class="bible">
        "You have heard that it was said, 'Love your
        neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I tell you:
        Love your enemies and pray for those who
        persecute you, that you may be sons of your
        Father in heaven." (Matt 5:43-44)
      </p>

      <p>
        Why do you think Jesus starts off his sermon on
        the mount by making such a radical set of statements? In
        effect, he is quoting the Law of the Old Covenant and
        saying that those things are no longer valid. Instead, he’s
        replacing the commands of the Old Covenant with brand
        new, Kingdom-centric ideas which go beyond mere
        obedience. These words of Jesus speak of the heart, not
        simply about rules to follow.
      </p>

      <p class="bible">
        “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law
        or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them
        but to fulfill them.” (Matt 5:17)
      </p>

      <p>
        So, Jesus came to announce the Kingdom of God
        and to proclaim a New Covenant. He did this, first of all,
        by fulfilling the Old Covenant. These were but shadows,
        according to the author of Hebrews.
      </p>

      <p class="bible">
        “The law is only a shadow of the good things that
        are coming—not the realities themselves.”
        (Hebrews 10:1)
      </p>


      <p>
        The New Covenant is not like the Old. So, we
        shouldn't be surprised at the differences. The Old
        Covenant has now been fulfilled in Christ, and now that
        Old Covenant is no longer in effect. It has been fulfilled.
        Now, we are living under the New Covenant which Jesus
        came to inaugurate. He is the High Priest of this New
        Covenant and He has outlined for us, in the Gospel, what
        life in the Kingdom should look like.
      </p>

      <p>
        No longer will we live by the code, “An eye for an
        eye” but now we will live by the new code, “Love your
        enemies.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The Old Testament and New Testament are not
        concurrent realities. The Old Covenant is fulfilled in Christ
        and now we are under a New Covenant. Behold the old
        is gone and the new has come.</p>
      <p>
        This does not imply that the Old Covenant
        scriptures are irrelevant at all. These are still valuable to
        us so that we can comprehend how they were fulfilled in
        Jesus. But these are still shadows which point to Jesus.</p>

      <p>
        “You diligently study the Scriptures because you
        think that by them you possess eternal life. These
        are the Scriptures that testify about me, yet you
        refuse to come to me to have life.” (John 5:39-40)</p>

      <p>
        According to the Old Covenant, God promised to
        send His Messiah to fulfill the prophecies concerning a
        New Covenant. This Messiah would be a priest and a
        king, and he would be the one who would build a temple
        for God – one not made with human hands.</p>


      <p>
        Throughout the ministry of Jesus, we see him
        emphasizing the temporal nature of the shadow and the
        eternal qualities of the Kingdom of God. Specifically,
        Jesus quite often speaks about the Temple in terms that
        make the Jewish religious class very nervous.</p>

      <p class="bible">
        "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise
        it up." (John 2:19)</p>

      <p>
        Jesus was the fulfillment of the shadow found in
        the Old Covenant priesthood. He is now our only High
        Priest.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jesus was the fulfillment of the shadow of the
        sacrificial lamb who takes away our sins. We no longer
        require a blood sacrifice as part of our worship to God.
      </p>


      <p>
        Jesus was the fulfillment of the shadow of the
        temple. We no longer need to travel to a physical,
        geographical holy place to come into the presence of
        Almighty God.
      </p>


      <p>
        <span class="quote">“One greater than the temple has come,”</span> Jesus
        said in Matthew 12:6. At his crucifixion, God tore the veil
        in the temple in two, from top to bottom, to signify the end
        of that old covenant temple system. The priests, the
        animal sacrifice, and even the temple itself are all now
        superfluous and unnecessary.
      </p>


      <p>
        The author of Hebrews summarizes all of this for
        us when he says:
      </p>


      <p class="bible">
        “When Christ came as <b>high priest</b> of the good
        things that are already here, he went through the
        greater and more <b>perfect tabernacle</b> that is <b>not
          man-made</b>, that is to say, not a part of this
        creation. He did not enter by means of the blood of
        goats and calves; but he entered the Most Holy
        Place once for all by his own blood, having
        obtained eternal redemption.” (Hebrews 9:11-12;
        emphasis mine)
      </p>


      <p>
        Here we see that Jesus fulfilled the shadows of
        high priest, temple, and sacrificial lamb. He took the role
        of High Priest when He offered Himself as the
        unblemished Lamb of God, in the temple of His body.
        Thus, Jesus reveals that He was what each of these
        shadows were pointing to all along. These shadows are
        all fulfilled in Christ.
      </p>



      <p>
        But why did Jesus do all of this? What are the
        practical implications of these actions for those of us who
        are now living under a New Covenant?
      </p>


      <p>
        Here’s the beautiful symmetry of what Christ
        accomplished for us:
      </p>


      <p>
        Jesus is our High Priest so that we can become a
        Kingdom of Priests.
      </p>


      <p class="bible">
        “You have made them to be a kingdom and priests
        to serve our God, and they will reign on the earth."
        (Revelation 5:10)
      </p>


      <p>
        Jesus is the Living Temple of God so that we can
        become the Temple of the Holy Spirit.
      </p>


      <p class="bible">
        “Do you not know that your body is a temple of the
        Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have
        received from God? You are not your own.” (1
        Corinthians 6:19)
      </p>


      <p>
        Jesus is the Lamb of God so that we can also
        become living sacrifices to God.
      </p>


      <p class="bible">
        “Therefore, I urge you, brothers, in view of God's
        mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices,
        holy and pleasing to God—this is your spiritual act
        of worship.” (Romans 12:1)
      </p>


      <p>
        In fact, all of this is confirmed in the writings of
        Peter who says,
      </p>


      <p class="bible">
        “As you come to him, the living Stone—rejected by
        men but chosen by God and precious to him—
        you also, <b>like living stones, are being built into
          a spiritual house</b> to be a <b>holy priesthood,</b>
        <b>offering spiritual sacrifices</b> acceptable to God
        through Jesus Christ...But you are a chosen
        people, <b>a royal priesthood</b>, a holy nation, a
        people belonging to God, that you may declare the
        praises of him who called you out of darkness into
        his wonderful light. Once you were not a people,
        but now you are the people of God; once you had
        not received mercy, but now you have received
        mercy.” (1 Peter 2:4-5; 9-10; emphasis added).
      </p>


      <p>
        As we’ve already seen, the Messiah was sent, in
        part, to build a temple for God that was “not made by
        human hands”. Yet, when Jesus walked the Earth, there
        was already a physical temple standing in Jerusalem.
        What was the temple that Jesus came to establish? It
        was you and I – the living temple of the Holy Spirit.
      </p>


      <p>
        Jesus fulfilled His mission and built a house for
        God. Jesus alone was the one who fashioned a resting
        place for His Father. He did what David, and Solomon
        and all the rest could never do. He built an acceptable
        temple for God that was cleansed with His own blood and
        purified by the Lamb of God.
      </p>


      <p class="bible">
        “For we are the temple of the living God. As God
        has said: ‘I will live with them and walk among
        them, and I will be their God, and they will be my
        people.’" (2 Corinthians 6:16).
      </p>


      <p>
        What is the purpose of a temple? It's a Holy Place.
        It's where people can go to find God, to approach Him
        and to enter into His presence.
      </p>


      <p>
        If you and I are now the temple of God on this
        earth, this means that whenever people come to you,
        whether they know it or not, they are standing in front of
        the temple of the Living God.
      </p>


      <p>
        "But Christ is faithful as a son over God's house.
        And we are his house, if we hold on to our
        courage and the hope of which we boast."
        (Hebrews 3:6).
      </p>

      <p>
        Even though we often think of the Church as a
        building, it is not a building. The Church is an organism,
        not an organization. The Church is made only of living,
        breathing people who carry around with them the Holy
        Presence of the Living God in their hearts.
      </p>


      <p>
        If you have surrendered your life to Christ, then
        God lives in you by His Spirit. He has made His home in
        you, by your faith in Christ Jesus and the finished work of
        Christ on the cross. This is not a small thing. In fact, the
        ripping of the veil in Solomon's Temple, the cloth
        separating God and mankind, was ripped from top to
        bottom the very instant that Jesus accomplished His work
        on the cross.
      </p>


      <p class="bible">
        "And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud
        voice, he gave up his spirit. <b>At that moment</b> the
        curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to
        bottom." (Matt. 27:50-51).
      </p>


      <p>
        God did not wait even one second longer than
        necessary to remove the veil which separated us from
        Himself. How could we ever again seek to repair this veil
        and establish again a series of religious barriers between
        ourselves and God?
      </p>


      <p>
        We are the only House that God has ever built.
        We are the only temple ever commissioned by God to
        house His Holy Presence.
      </p>


      <p>
        The True and Living God has built for Himself a
        living, breathing temple on this earth and we are that
        temple.
      </p>


      <p>
        So, we see from the Scriptures that it was always
        God’s plan to fulfill the shadows of priesthood, temple
        and sacrifice through the promised Messiah. When the
        Messiah came, He revealed that He was the reality to
        which these shadows pointed. When Jesus fulfilled these
        shadows at the cross, they ceased to be necessary. This
        means we no longer require a special clergy or priestly
        class of men to operate as a type of Christ for us
        because the Christ Himself has already come. We no
        longer require the blood of sheep to cover our sins,
        because the Lamb of God has already come and offered
        Himself as the perfect atonement for our sins. We no
        longer require a special, holy place where we must go to
        meet with God because God has fulfilled His promise to
        us and He has made us to be the temple of His Holy
        Spirit.
      </p>


      <p>
        I believe that it is for these reasons that the New
        Testament Church did not seek to build temples where
        they could worship, or to ordain priests who would act as
        spiritual mediators, or to offer blood sacrifices on the altar
        for the forgiveness of sins. They understood that Christ
        had fulfilled all of these shadows. They fully recognized
        that they were now the temple of the Holy Spirit. They
        understood that they themselves were now God’s Holy
        Priesthood, offering themselves to God as daily, living,
        sacrifices.
      </p>


      <p>
        This was not an arbitrary decision. It was not one
        based upon cultural restrictions, nor did it mirror the
        Jewish or Pagan systems of the day. Instead, it was an
        organic model founded upon Christ Himself and revealed
        in the Holy Word of God.
      </p>


      <p>
        Is it any wonder that Jesus cried from the cross, “It
        is finished!” after accomplishing all of this? The cross of
        Jesus accomplished so much more for us than
        forgiveness of sins and eternal life. He fulfilled the
        promises of the Old Covenant to usher in the ongoing
        reality of a New Covenant where God’s greatest desire
        could be fully realized.
