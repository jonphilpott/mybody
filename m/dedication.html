    <h1> DEDICATION </h1>
    <p> This book is dedicated to my wife, and my very best friend,
      Wendy. Youâ€™re my inspiration on this grand adventure.</p>
    <h1> SPECIAL THANKS </h1>
    <p>
      Without the tireless and constant assistance
      of Jon Zens, this book might never have seen
      print. Thanks for your encouragement
      and your hard work.
