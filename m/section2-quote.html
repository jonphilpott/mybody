"Increasing institutionalism is the clearest mark of
early Catholicism - when church becomes increasingly
identified with institution, when authority becomes
increasingly coterminous with office, when a basic
distinction between clergy and laity becomes increasingly
self-evident, when grace becomes increasingly narrowed
to well-defined ritual acts....such features were absent
from first generation Christianity, though in the second
generation the picture was beginning to change."
