    <h1>The New Covenant of God</h1>
<p>
From the beginning, God’s plan was to make His
home with mankind. The first book of the Bible lays out
for us God’s original design for all of creation and at the
center of this is His intimate desire to be with us.
</p>


<p>
The Garden of Eden was a type of temple – a
sanctuary where God and man could fellowship and
commune together. After the Fall, the tabernacle and the
temple served as shadows which pointed to the one, true
temple which was to come - one not made with human
hands. The Apostles and the first Christians were thrilled
to realize that they were living in the reality of these
promises, and they proclaimed it loudly. As Stephen said
before he was stoned to death:
</p>


<p class="bible">
“However, <b>the Most High does not live in
houses made by men.</b> As the prophet says:
"'Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my
footstool. What kind of house will you build for
me? says the Lord. Or where will my resting place
be? Has not my hand made all these things?'”
(Acts 7:48-50)
</p>



<p>
Paul also echoed this truth when he spoke to the
worshippers of the “Unknown God” in Athens saying,
</p>


<p class="bible">
“"The God who made the world and everything
in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not
live in temples built by hands.” (Acts 17:24)
</p>


<p>
The early Christians knew that Jesus had died to
fulfill the Old Covenant and rose from the dead to preside
over a New Covenant that was promised long ago. The
Jewish leaders of the day also fully understood that the
preaching of the Gospel posed a threat to their status
quo. This is partly why they opposed Stephen and
accused him of <span class="quote">“speaking against this holy place and
against the law.”</span> (Acts 6:14) It’s also why they opposed
Paul and arrested him at the temple in Jerusalem saying,
<b><span class="quote">“This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against
our people and our law and this place.”</span></b> (Acts 21:28)
</p>

<p>
In the New Testament we see that many
understood that what Jesus had inaugurated was the
foundation of a brand new temple “not made with human
hands” that made the existing temple obsolete and
superfluous.
</p>


<p class="bible">
“This is the covenant I will make with the house of
Israel after that time, declares the Lord. I will put
my laws in their minds and write them on their
hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my
people. No longer will a man teach his neighbor,
or a man his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord,'
because they will all know me, from the least of
them to the greatest. For I will forgive their
wickedness and will remember their sins no more."
(Jeremiah 31:31-34)
</p>


<p>
At the feast of Pentecost, the birthday of the New
Testament ekklesia, Peter confirmed that what God
promised to do in the Old Testament scriptures through
the prophet of Joel was being fulfilled in their very
presence.
</p>


<p>
“'In the last days, God says, I will pour out my
Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will
prophesy, your young men will see visions, your
old men will dream dreams. Even on my servants,
both men and women, I will pour out my Spirit in
those days, and they will prophesy.” (Acts 2:17-18)
</p>


<p>
God’s promise was fulfilled at Pentecost. He
poured out His Spirit on all flesh – not just on the prophet,
not just on the men, but on women, and children, on the
old and on the young. This was the inauguration of
something radically different than what had gone before.
</p>


<p>
Later, through both Peter and Paul, God would
confirm by His Spirit that this outpouring was not only for
the Jews, but also for the Gentiles as well.
</p>


<p class="bible">
“For there is no difference between Jew and
Gentile—the same Lord is Lord of all and richly
blesses all who call on him.” (Romans 10:12)
</p>


<p class="bible">
“Therefore, remember that formerly you who are
Gentiles by birth....that at that time you were
separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in
Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the
promise, without hope and without God in the
world. But now in Christ Jesus you who once were
far away have been brought near through the
blood of Christ....His purpose was to create in
himself one new man out of the two, thus making
peace, and in this one body to reconcile both of
them to God through the cross, by which he put to
death their hostility. He came and preached peace
to you who were far away and peace to those who
were near. For through him we both have access
to the Father by one Spirit.” (Ephesians 2:11-18)
</p>



<p>
God’s New Covenant with man was no longer
confined only to one race of people, but now it was wide
open to every living, breathing human being on the planet
who responded to the open invitation of Jesus to follow
after Him.
</p>


<p class="bible">
“Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and
aliens, but fellow citizens with God's people and
members of God's household, built on the
foundation of the apostles and prophets, with
Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone. <b>In
him the whole building is joined together and
rises to become a holy temple in the Lord. And
in him you too are being built together to
become a dwelling in which God lives by his
Spirit.”</b> (Ephesians 2:19-22)
</p>


<p>
The new, living, breathing temple of God was now
unleashed upon the earth and set free to expand and
cover the whole of creation, without limit or boundary. As
Jesus promised, <span class="bible">“...I will build my church and the gates
of hell shall not prevail against it.” (Matthew 16:18)</span>
</p>


<p>
God’s New Testament Temple was built upon the
Chief Cornerstone, and there is no longer any other “Holy
Place” than the heart of every believer, and the collective
ekklesia (gathering) of God’s people. As Dr. G.K. Beale
said to me:
</p>


<p class="bible">
“Hebrews chapter 9 uses the word parable to refer
to the physical Temple (v 8-9). The physical, Old
Testament Temple is not the literal Temple. It’s the
illustrative Temple. The Temple that Jesus has
begun to establish is called the “True Temple”. So,
to look at the picture is not to see the substance
that is already here....Christ is the true Israel. He
is the true Temple. So, to look longingly at the
picture of a physical temple is to make the same
mistake. The substance is here, (in Christ).”<a class="fn" href="footnotes.html@section-1-5-2">2</a>
</p>



<p>
As we’ve already seen, the symbols of the Old
Covenant were shadows, not the realities themselves.
The shadow of the physical temple was revealed in the
true temple of Christ’s body. The shadow of the
priesthood was revealed in the person of Jesus our High
Priest. The shadow of the blood sacrifice was fulfilled in
the sacrifice of the Lamb of God who gave Himself for the
sins of the world.
</p>


<p>
What would be the point of going back to the Old
Covenant shadows now that the light has come and
these things have found fulfillment in Christ?
</p>


<p>
The Old Covenant model depended on incomplete
symbols, whereas the New Covenant model is the true
reality. Instead of a select group of men set aside as
mediators between God and man, the New Covenant
priesthood includes every man, woman and child in the
Kingdom of God. Instead of a single, man-made temple
in one geographic location, the New Covenant temple
has expanded to fill every baptized believer in Christ
Jesus. Instead of a blood sacrifice to provide a temporary
covering for our sins, we have all been covered in the
Blood of the Lamb and we ourselves are now the living
sacrifices of God.
</p>


<p>
We must remember also that the Old Covenant
forms of worship were man-made and not God’s original
desire for His people. When He created all things, God
made a place where He would be free to relate to His
creation. In the Garden we see God’s true heart
revealed. Yet this goal was circumvented when mankind
made a choice to disobey.
</p>


<p>
When God brought His people out of Egypt and
lead them into the desert and towards the promised land
it was the people, not God, who suggested that Moses
speak to them on behalf of God.
</p>


<p class="bible">
“When the people saw the thunder and lightning
and heard the trumpet and saw the mountain in
smoke, they trembled with fear. They stayed at a
distance and said to Moses, ‘Speak to us yourself
and we will listen. But do not have God speak to
us or we will die.” (Exodus 20:18-19)
</p>

Later, in the days of the prophet Samuel we read
how God’s people rejected God as their King.


<p class="bible">
“But when they said, ‘Give us a King to lead us,’
this displeased Samuel so he prayed to the Lord.
And the Lord told him: Listen to all that the people
are saying to you; it is not you they have rejected,
but they have rejected me as their king.” (1 Samuel 8:6-7)
</p>



<p>
It was never God’s plan to create divisions
between Himself and His people. Instead, it was Adam’s
sin in the Garden that created the first divide. Then it was
the fear of the Israelites in the desert that put a mediator
between us and God, and finally it was the desire of a
nation to be like “all the other nations” that brought the
final rejection of God as King.
</p>


<p>
The Old Covenant is filled with examples like this
where God desires to pull His people closer and His
people continually pull back because of fear, and sin, and
pride.
</p>


<p>
But the Good News of the New Covenant is that
God has made a way for us to live free of sin. He’s made
a way for love to cast out all fear. He’s promised to give
grace to those who are humble.
</p>


<p>
The New Covenant is the fulfillment of God’s
glorious dream where “I will be their God and they will be
my people”.
</p>


<p>
Does anyone dare to pick up a needle and thread
in an attempt to repair the old veil? Would anyone be so
foolish as to long for anything less than the complete
expression of this new reality we have found in Christ?
</p>


<p>
Certainly there was a time in history when it was
appropriate to build a holy place where a holy man could
perform a holy work. But this time has long passed. This
shadow has long since been eclipsed by the Light of the
World.
</p>


<p>
To this very day there is no physical Jewish
temple of worship in Jerusalem or anywhere else. Why?
Because these shadows have served their purpose.
We have a New Covenant now. One where every
believer can now be ordained into the priesthood of God,
(1 Peter 2:5) and every believer is now the daily, living
sacrifice (Romans 12), and every believer is now the
temple of the Holy Spirit. (1 Cor 6:19)
