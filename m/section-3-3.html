      <h1>In Process</h1>


      <p>
        One thing that I’ve learned over the last few years
        is that all of us are in process. Opinions I held a few
        years ago have been replaced by new convictions, and
        things I would never have dreamed of before are now
        more real to me than I could have ever imagined.
        Because of this I am learning how to have grace for
        others who may not agree with me about certain things. I
        often ask for them to extend grace to me as well.
      </p>


      <p>
        Following Jesus has been an adventure for me.
        This roller coaster ride is really only beginning, I know.
        So, there’s really no easy way to end this book. Every
        week I learn something new and I discover something
        amazing that I have to share with our house church
        family or with those who follow my blog.
      </p>


      <p>
        I hope this book has been a blessing to you, and I
        hope that at least some of what I have shared about
        God’s desire for a Church that embodies His Spirit and
        lives out His love for others has been encouraging to you.
      </p>


      <p>
        If you have any questions or insights regarding
        what you’ve read here, I would love to hear from you.
      </p>


      <p>
        May God continue to challenge you as you seek
        His face and may you always have the courage to walk
        with Him wherever He calls you to go
