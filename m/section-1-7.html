    <h1>Ordination is for Every Believer</h1>

<p>
There are some who strongly object to the idea of
a special group of clergy class Christians who are
ordained into the ministry of the Gospel. However, I think
the real sin is that <i>everyone</i> who follows Jesus isn’t
ordained into the ministry.
</p>


<p>
As W.Carl Ketcherside remarks in his book, The
Royal Priesthood:
</p>


<p class="bible">
(In the early Church) “Those who were Christians
did not speak of ‘entering the ministry.’ They were
already in it. Everyone entered the ministry at
baptism. To be in Christ was to be in the ministry.
No one went away to study for ‘the Ministry.’ Each
one began where he was and announced the
Messiah who had come. People did not send for a
preacher. They just began preaching. All who had
been inducted into the kingdom could tell what
they did and why they did it. Every Christian was a
minister, everyone was a priest. The congregation
was a priesthood--a royal priesthood composed of
all believers.”
</p>


<p>
Our current model of ordination is flawed, but for
me the flaw is not that certain men are ordained, but that
not all men and women are ordained into the ministry.
</p>


<p>
Rather than to condemn those who hear God’s
voice and respond to His calling on their lives to serve
others and follow Jesus with their whole life, let’s applaud
their example and take this practice all the way to the
finish line by opening wide the doors to enter the ministry
of Jesus.
</p>


<p class="bible">
“Again Jesus said, "Peace be with you! As the
Father has sent me, I am sending you." (John
20:21).
</p>


<p>
Every believer is in the ministry of Christ. Each of
us has been called, and sent, and gifted, to love and
serve and proclaim the Gospel of the Kingdom to
everyone we meet.
</p>


<p>
This doesn’t mean that we are all evangelists, or
that we are all church-planters, or that we are all teachers
(see 1 Corinthians 12). However, it does mean that we
are all part of the Body of Christ and that the Holy Spirit
has gifted each of us with an important and necessary
set of spiritual gifts. These gifts are meant to be used in
proportion to our specific calling.
</p>


<p>
Honestly, I have been licensed and ordained since
I was 22 years old, but these days I wish I didn't have the
paper. In the beginning it gave me validation for stepping
out under the authority of God, but now I can see that it
has also created a false sense of clergy and laity – even
in our own house church setting.
</p>


<p>
For example, when we had our first baptism in our
house church family, I was the one who performed it. It
didn't even occur to me that by taking that position I was
robbing others of the experience we should all feel free to
enjoy. Needless to say, I will not do that again, nor will I
lead the communion for everyone else, or rule the
meeting as if this were my church to do with as I please.
</p>

<p>
So, are you a Priest in God's House? Yes, you
are. Every follower of Jesus is a Missionary – in the
sense that each of us “in the ministry.” The essential
thing for each of us, then, is to discover our mission field
(where we live, work, eat and sleep), and to step into our
ministry (which is determined by our specific gifting by
the Holy Spirit).
</p>


<p>
Now, for those of you who consider yourselves
followers of Jesus, I encourage you to go out into your
mission field and to step into your daily ministry, because
you and I are all ordained into the ministry of Jesus. We
are all filled with the Holy Spirit of the Living God. We are
Temples of the Holy Spirit. We are all priests of God. We
are all living sacrifices.
</p>


<p>
You have been ordained into the ministry of Jesus,
my friends. Let us walk and live and love accordingly.
