      <h1>A Profound Mystery</h1>

      <p>
        When you consider that the Bible as we know it
        today was written over a period of thousands of years, by
        a wide variety of authors, and assembled as a single
        document nearly two thousand years ago, it's fairly
        miraculous that the first three chapters of the Bible
        correspond so symmetrically with the last three chapters
        of the Bible.
      </p>


      <p>
        In the first three chapters of the Bible, in the book
        of Genesis, we see a series of events that are mirrored in
        the last three chapters of Revelation.
      </p>


      <p>
        First, we see the creation of heaven and earth. At
        the end of Revelation we see a new creation.
        In the first three chapters we see Satan ensnaring
        mankind and in the last three we see Satan cast down
        and doomed forever.
      </p>


      <p>
        In the first three chapters we see a garden, and in
        the last three chapters we see a garden city. Both
        gardens include the tree of life.
      </p>


      <p>
        In the first three chapters we have a curse given to
        man for his sins, and in the last three chapters the curse
        is forever removed.
      </p>


      <p>
        In the first three chapters God visits the garden in
        the cool of the day, and in the last three chapters God is
        at home with man forever.
      </p>



      <p>
        In the first three chapters man and woman are
        cast out, but in the last three chapters they are welcomed
        in.
      </p>


      <p>
        In the first three chapters a bride is created from
        out of Adam’s side, and in the last three chapters a Bride
        is ushered in for the Son of God and a wedding feast is
        celebrated.
      </p>


      <p>
        In the first three chapters we have the beginning of
        Time, and in the last three we have the beginning of
        Eternity.
      </p>


      <h2>DEEPER THINGS</h2>


      The Scriptures reveal the Church to be the Bride
      of the Lamb. It is one of the most common metaphors
      used by God to describe His people throughout the Bible.
      However, if we begin to trace these threads between
      Genesis and Revelation we will notice even more about
      <p>
        what Paul the Apostle refers to as "a profound mystery."
      </p>


      In Ephesians, Paul uses the metaphor of marriage
      to teach us something astounding about Jesus and about
      our identity as the Bride of Christ. I've edited the text to
      <p>
        highlight the main thoughts:
      </p>

      <p class="bible">

        "...just as Christ loved the church and gave himself
        up for her to make her holy, cleansing her by the
        washing with water through the word, and to
        present her to himself as a radiant church, without
        stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and
        blameless." (Eph 5:25-27)

      </p>


      <p class="bible">

        "'For this reason a man will leave his father and
        mother and be united to his wife, and the two will
        become one flesh.' This is a profound mystery —
        but I am talking about Christ and the church." (Eph
        5:31-32)

      </p>



      <p>
        Because this passage is so often used to counsel
        men and women in regards to the marriage relationship, I
        have removed those references so that we can see what
        Paul says he is actually talking about: <span class="quote">"Christ and the
          church.”</span>
      </p>


      <p>
        First, Paul tells us how Christ has given himself up
        for us (the Bride) and how he cleanses and washes us
        through the word of God so that we might be ready for
        our wedding day. Paul also quotes from Genesis chapter
        2 in this passage and this reminds us of how God put
        Adam to sleep and made a woman for him because <span class="quote">"God
          saw that it was not good for man to be alone.”</span>
      </p>


      <p>
        Notice it was God's idea, not Adam's, for man to
        have a wife. Somehow this reference points to God's plan
        for the Church. As Paul reminds us, <span class="quote">"For this reason"</span> the
        man is to <span class="quote">"leave his father and mother and be united with
          his wife and the two will become one flesh.”</span> This is where
        Paul pauses and remarks that <span class="quote">"this is a profound
          mystery.”</span> Why? Because he is not talking about Adam
        and Eve now. He's not talking about Christian marriage
        between a man and a woman. No, he is talking about
        Jesus and the Church <span class="quote">"becoming one flesh".</span>
      </p>


      <h2>THE MYSTERY OF THE BRIDE</h2>

      <p>
        We know from God’s word that we (the Church)
        are the Bride of Christ (Eph 5:22-33). But in Revelation
        we learn that the Bride is also a City:
      </p>


      <p class="bible">
        “One of the seven angels who had the seven
        bowls full of the seven last plagues came and said
        to me, ‘Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of
        the Lamb.’ And he carried me away in the Spirit to
        a mountain great and high, and showed me the
        Holy City, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven
        from God.” (Rev 21:9-10)
      </p>


      <p>
        We are the Bride, and the Bride is a City.
      </p>



      <h2>THE MYSTERY OF THE TEMPLE</h2>

      <p>
        We also know that we are the Temple of God (Eph
        2:21), but in Revelation we discover that it is Christ who
        is the Temple in us:
      </p>


      <p class="bible">
        "The great street of the city was of pure gold, like
        transparent glass. I did not see a temple in the
        city, because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb
        are its temple." (Rev 21:21-22)
      </p>


      <p>
        So, we are the Temple where God dwells within,
        but we are also the Bride which is a city and in that city is
        a Temple which is the Lord Himself.
      </p>


      <h2>IN CHRIST JESUS</h2>

      <p>
        Want to see how this is played out in the rest of
        the Scriptures? In the Gospel of John, beyond the prayer
        of Jesus to the Father that we (the Bride) would be one
        even as Jesus and the Father are one, Christ also prays:
      </p>


      <p class="bible">
        "Father, just as you are in me and I am in you.
        May they also be in us so that the world may
        believe that you have sent me. I have given them
        the glory that you gave me, that they may be one
        as we are one: I in them and you in me. May they
        be brought to complete unity to let the world know
        that you sent me and have loved them even as
        you have loved me." (John 17:21-23)
      </p>


      <p>
        In Ephesians 2:21 we are told that we are the
        Temple of God, as we have already seen, but look at
        what this passage actually communicates. Try to guess
        where God ends and we begin here:
      </p>


      <p>
        "In him the whole building is joined together and
        rises to become a holy temple in the Lord. And in
        him you too are being built together to become a
        dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit." (Eph
        2:21-22)
      </p>


      <p>
        Here we see that we (the Church, the Bride, the
        Body and the Temple) are being built to become a
        dwelling in which God lives, and yet the Temple is being
        built "in him.” So, we are being built in Christ to become a
        Temple where God will dwell by His Spirit. Who is on the
        inside? Who is dwelling where? We are in Christ, and we
        contain God's Spirit all at the same time.
      </p>


      <h2>THE MYSTERY OF THE BODY</h2>


      <p>
        In 1 Corinthians 12, and in Ephesians 4:15, Paul
        gives us another wonderful illustration of how the Body is
        to function. He refers to the Church as the Body of Christ
        and explains that we are dependent upon one another for
        life, and yet that Christ is our Head and without Him we
        can do nothing (see also John 15:5). Here we have a
        wonderful picture of the unity which Jesus prayed we
        would have (John 17:21-23) and a fulfillment of the
        picture that we are "one flesh" (Genesis 2:24, Eph 2:21),
        with Christ since we are His Body and He is our head.
      </p>


      <p>
        As I look at who we are in Christ, (His Body,
        Temple and Bride), and as I see God's sovereign plan
        from the beginning (to find a Bride for His Son, and a
        Temple for His presence), and as I hear the prayer of
        Jesus that we be in Him and that we be one even as He
        and the Father are one, I cannot help but feel an urgency
        to tear down our man-made divisions and embrace our
        identity as members of one Body, with one Head.
      </p>


      <h2>THE GLORIOUS MYSTERY OF GOD</h2>

      <p>
        This mystery is quite profound. One worthy of our
        awe. It is not my goal to explain or understand this
        mystery. One dear brother I shared this with recently said
        to me, "Let it continue to be a mystery in your heart" and
        that is my intention. This is a profound mystery and what
        we must contemplate is not how to make sense of it, but
        instead how to live out our part of it.
      </p>


      <p>
        How can we be one in Christ? How can we make
        Christ the head of our Church? How can we be the
        Temple of the Living God? How can we make ourselves
        ready for that glorious wedding day to come?
      </p>


      <h2>THE END IS THE BEGINNING</h2>

      <p>
        The last thing I see as I look at the symmetry
        between Genesis and Revelation is that all of History
        ends with a wedding. All that we have known, and all that
        we now experience is only the courtship. This is just the
        engagement phase of our life with Christ. One day we will
        become the Bride of Christ and be one with Him. Yet, a
        wedding is not the end of life, it is only the beginning.
        God's Word ends with a beginning. This is a very
        profound mystery, indeed.
