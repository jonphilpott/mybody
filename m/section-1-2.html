      <h1>God's New Temple</h1>

      <p>    
        To understand God’s design for His New
        Testament Church, we have to look at the Old
        Testament. Specifically, we must look for prophecies
        given by God about a new temple, and we must try to
        understand what He was trying to accomplish in raising it
        up.
      </p>

      <p>One of the most startling prophecies concerning
        the Messiah and his role in establishing this new temple
        is found in Zechariah.
      </p>

      <p class="bible">
        “Listen, O high priest Joshua and your associates
        seated before you, who are men symbolic of
        things to come: I am going to bring my servant, the
        Branch.” (Zechariah 3:8)
      </p>

      <p>
        In this passage, God speaks to the high priest of
        Israel at this time whose name was translated “Joshua.”
        Of course, we know that this name is synonymous with
        “Y’shua” or “Jesus” and this is not an accident. God
        points out the significance of this to Zechariah, saying:
      </p>

      <p class="bible">
        “The word of the LORD came to me: ‘Take the silver and gold....and make a crown, and set it on the head of the high priest, Joshua son of Jehozadak. Tell him this is what the LORD Almighty says: <b>'Here is the man whose name is the Branch,</b> and he will branch out from his place <b>and build the temple of the LORD.</b>’” 
        (Zechariah 6:9-12)
      </p>


      <p>Several significant things can be said about this
        remarkable passage. First, God asks Zechariah to
        fashion a crown of silver and gold and place it on the
        head of “Y’shua” the high priest. By doing this, God is
        declaring that this priest is to also be crowned as a king.</p>

      <p>Secondly, God confirms that the Branch, or the
        Messiah, will have the name “Y’shua” or “Jesus”. Notice,
        it is his name which is the Branch.
      </p>

      <p>Remember, God has already revealed that
        “Y’shua” the high priest is a man “symbolic of things to
        come” and part of this symbolism is revealed in his name.
      </p>

      <p>Therefore, these prophecies in Zechariah teach us
        that the Messiah who is to come will be a priest and a
        king, and his name will be Jesus, and also that:
      </p>

      <p class="bible">
        “<b>It is he who will build the temple of the Lord,</b>
        and he will be clothed with majesty and will sit and
        rule on his throne. <b>And he will be a priest on his
          throne. And there will be harmony between the
          two.'</b> (Zechariah 6:13)
      </p>

      <p>Clearly, this scripture tells us that building the
        temple of the Lord was part of the mission of the coming
        Messiah, and that his identity as a priest and a king
        would have significance in his kingdom.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2 Samuel we read where King David looked
        around his opulent cedar palace and concluded that it
        wasn't right that he should live in such  splendor while
        God lived in a tent outside the city.
      </p>

      <p class="bible">
        “After the king was settled in his palace and the
        Lord had given him rest from all his enemies
        around him, he said to Nathan the prophet, ’Here I
        am, living in a palace of cedar, while the ark of
        God remains in a tent.’ Nathan replied to the king,
        ‘Whatever you have in mind, go ahead and do it,
        for the Lord is with you.’" (2 Samuel 7:1)
      </p>

      <p>
        When David tells the prophet Nathan that he
        intends to build a house for God the prophet
        enthusiastically tells David that he is certain God will be
        with him no matter what he plans to do.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, that very night God nudges Nathan and
        gives him a surprising response to David’s request.
      </p>

      <p class="bible">
        “Go and tell my servant David, 'This is what the
        LORD says: Are you the one to build me a house
        to dwell in? I have not dwelt in a house from the
        day I brought the Israelites up out of Egypt to this
        day. I have been moving from place to place with
        a tent as my dwelling. Wherever I have moved
        with all the Israelites, did I ever say to any of their
        rulers whom I commanded to shepherd my people
        Israel, ‘Why have you not built me a house of
        cedar?’” (2 Samuel 1:5-7)
      </p>

      <p>
        Here, God questions whether David, or anyone
        else, is capable of building a house for God to dwell in.
        As God says later through the prophet Isaiah, <span class="quote">"Heaven is
          my throne, and the earth is my footstool. Where is the
          house you will build for me? Where will my resting place
          be?”</span> (Isaiah 66:1) Instead, God tells David something
        startling:
      </p>

      <p class="bible">
        “The LORD declares to you that <b>the LORD
          himself will establish a house for you</b>. When
        your days are over and you rest with your fathers,
        I will raise up your offspring to succeed you, who
        will come from your own body, and I will establish
        his kingdom. <b>He is the one who will build a
          house for my Name, and I will establish the
          throne of his kingdom forever.</b> I will be his
        father, and he will be my son." (2 Samuel 7:11-14)
      </p>

      <p>
        Not only will God not allow David to build Him a
        house, God is promising that He, the Lord Himself, would
        build a house for David. His promise is that, through the
        Messiah who would come from the Davidic bloodline,
        God would build a house for His Name and establish a
        kingdom that would last forever.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clearly, from this passage and from the Zechariah
        passage we see confirmation of a Messianic calling to
        build the temple of God. More than this, God is clear that
        only the Messiah is qualified to build the temple he
        requires. This temple, as revealed in both passages
        above, is tied to the identity of the Messiah as a priest
        and a king who sits upon a throne which lasts forever and
        who rules over a kingdom that never ends.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Old Testament scriptures not only point to a
        Messianic temple being built, but to the passing away of
        the Levitical model of worship. One of the more startling
        examples of this is found in the book of Jeremiah.
      </p>

      <p class="bible">
        "In those days, when your numbers have
        increased greatly in the land,” declares the LORD,
        “men will no longer say, ‘The ark of the covenant
        of the LORD.’ It will never enter their minds or be
        remembered; it will not be missed, nor will another
        one be made. At that time they will call Jerusalem
        ‘The Throne of the LORD’, and all nations will
        gather in Jerusalem to honor the name of the
        LORD. No longer will they follow the stubbornness
        of their evil hearts." (Jeremiah 3:16-17)
      </p>

      <p>
        In this passage, God speaks of a time that is
        coming when no one will speak the name of the ark of
        the covenant, nor will it be remembered or missed or
        rebuilt. Why would this happen? How could this possibly
        be?
      </p>


      <p>
        The ark of the covenant was the place where the
        Holy Presence of God rested. It rested behind the thick
        veil of the tabernacle, and, eventually, within the temple
        itself in Jerusalem. Only the high priest could enter in at
        specific times to offer the sacrifice for God’s people. No
        one else was permitted to stand before the ark of the
        covenant, and even the priest who stood near it was in
        danger of falling dead if he failed to deal with his own sin
        accordingly.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ark of the covenant was central to Jewish
        temple worship. It represented the presence of the Living
        God as dwelling among His people. Without it, the entire
        meaning of the temple, the priesthood and the sacrifice
        was in question.</p>

      <p>
        Yet, God tells us that the day is coming when the
        ark, and all it represents will be forgotten, and never
        remembered or spoken of again among God's people.
        Even though the ark is absent, the nations of the earth
        gather to honor the name of the Lord and to worship
        God. In fact, the city of Jerusalem itself is identified as
        the throne of the Lord, or “the place where God dwells
        and reigns.”</p>
      <p>
        One can easily imagine how confusing, and even
        troubling this passage might be to a Jewish believer who
        has placed so much faith in the established system of
        temple worship. Yet, God is clearly communicating His
        intention to replace the old testament temple system of
        worship with something radically different. In other words,
        it will not look like what has been seen or understood to
        this point. The elements and the patterns of worship in
        this new temple of God will not mimic what has gone
        before.</p>

      <p>
        In his book, <span class="book">“The Temple and the Church’s
          Mission”</span>, Dr. G.K. Beale writes, concerning the Jeremiah
        passage above:
        
      </p>

      <p class="bookquote">
        "The reason the ark in the temple is not
        remembered is that a greater temple than the
        more physical one will encompass not only all of
        Jerusalem but the entire world. This future temple
        will be so incomparably greater than the former
        that God’s people will not even ‘remember it nor
        shall they miss it’. Furthermore, a physical ark
        within a small temple will ‘not be made again’
        because everything to which it pointed has been
        realized.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Another passage which can help us to understand
        the prophecy in Jeremiah is found in the book of Joel
        where God says,</p>

      <p class="bible">
        “I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons
        and daughters will prophesy, your old men will
        dream dreams, your young men will see visions.
        Even on my servants, both men and women, I will
        pour out my Spirit in those days.” (Joel 2:28-29)
      </p>

      <p>
        Obviously, if God’s Spirit is poured out on all
        people, the need for a physical ark where God’s
        presence dwells is eliminated.
        Moses himself dreamt of such a day when he said,</p>


      <p class="bible">
        “I wish that all the LORD's people were prophets
        and that the LORD would put his Spirit on them!"
        (Numbers 11:29)
      </p>

      <p>
        In Daniel 2:44-45, King Nebuchadnezzar's dream
        about the future is interpreted for us:</p>
      
      
      <p class="bible">
        "In the time of those kings, the God of heaven will
        set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor
        will it be left to another people. It will crush all
        those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it
        will itself endure forever. This is the meaning of
        the vision of the rock cut out of a mountain, but not
        by human hands — a rock that broke the iron, the
        bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold to pieces."
      </p>

      <p>
        This prophecy reveals that God's kingdom will be
        established, first as a small stone, cut from the rock, “but
        not by human hands”, and that it will grow to destroy
        every earthly kingdom and it will "never be destroyed" but
        "it will itself endure forever."</p>


      <p>
        From each of these passages we can see a
        pattern emerging. God is promising to send a Messiah.
        He will be a priest and a king. He will sit upon a throne
        which will last forever. This same king will come from the
        lineage of King David and he will be the one to build a
        temple for God. This new temple will not require an ark of
        the covenant to symbolize God’s presence among His
        people. Instead, the Spirit of God will be poured out upon
        all flesh and it will be so glorious that no one who
        experiences this will ever long to return to the old way of
        worship. The old covenant will be fulfilled, and a new
        covenant will replace it.
