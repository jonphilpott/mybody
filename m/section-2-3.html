      <h1>Spiritual Covering</h1>
      <p>
        Spiritual Covering is a concept built on fear and
        superstition, not on Biblical principles or values. Our
        house church believes in the Priesthood of the Believer.
        We believe that the Holy Spirit leads us into all Truth. We
        believe that the Word of God is active and powerful and
        effective to establish our Church and keep us on the path
        where Jesus walks.
      </p>


      <p>
        Essentially, our house church is not under any
        official "Spiritual Covering" of any sort. We do, however,
        have loads and loads of spiritual accountability, which is
        Biblical. I have mentors who I can call on (and I often do)
        for advice, guidance, and insight. These are people like
        David Ruis, Todd Hunter, Jon Zens, and a few other men
        of God who are smarter and wiser than I am. At the same
        time, I am personally accountable to every person in our
        group. They are accountable to one another and also to
        me.
      </p>


      <p>
        Our House Church is truly an independent
        endeavor. My wife and I left our previous church to start
        the house church without any official "covering" from any
        other church or organization.
      </p>


      <p>
        To be honest, I never really felt a need to research
        the whole question of spiritual covering because God had
        called me to step out and launch our house church and
        there had been no hint that we needed to do this with the
        "blessing" or "covering" of any other leader or organized
        church. However, about a year into our journey one of
        our dear friends asked us about our spiritual covering. I
        wasn't sure how to respond. I had my own, very strong
        opinions about the subject already in place, but I decided
        to at least entertain the subject and ask some of the
        spiritual advisors in my life what their take on the subject
        might be.
      </p>


      <p>
        So, I shot off an email to people like author Dallas
        Willard (author of "The Divine Conspiracy"), Todd Hunter
        (former National Director of Vineyard Churches), David
        Ruis (worship leader, author, songwriter), and also a few
        of my own personal mentors. These are made up of
        former pastors, chaplains, seminary graduates, and lay
        leaders. I asked them each to share with me their
        thoughts on the subject of "Spiritual Covering."
        Quite honestly, I expected a robust series of
        heated debates on the concept. Of that list, only two of
        them had any real bias in favor of house churches. All the
        rest were either full-time pastors of traditional churches or
        at least former pastors. Their responses truly surprised
        me.
      </p>


      <p>
        They each agreed with my conviction that
        "Spiritual Covering" was simply not a Biblical concept as
        most people understand it.
      </p>


      <p>
        First let me explain the basic idea behind "spiritual
        covering" here. Whenever someone, like myself for
        example, decides to start a church (house church or
        traditional), it is usually expected that the leader will
        submit his group to a higher organizational authority in
        order to protect the leader, and the new church, from
        doctrinal errors (heresy), and to protect against moral
        failures within the leadership staff.
      </p>

      <p>

        This sounds like common sense, and I have to
        admit that if we were starting a traditional church, I might
        agree that such a system might be prudent. However, the
        House Church by design is already a highly accountable
        group of like-minded people. In the House Church model,
        it's hard to be anonymous for very long. There is a high
        level of accountability in our small group. Plus, I do not
        lecture as the resident Biblical expert in our house
        church. Everyone, no matter how young or how old, is
        free to share scripture and discuss the Bible at length.
        Because of this, it's much more difficult for heretical ideas
        to flourish very long. In fact, at times my own children
        have corrected me and pointed out my errors in dividing
        the Scriptures. This teaches me to be humble and it
        allows everyone else to test what is being said against
        the Word of God.
      </p>


      <p>
        In contrast, the traditional church makes it much
        easier for people to remain anonymous and to wear
        masks that suggest "everything is alright.” A recent coffee
        meeting with a good friend of mine, who pastors a very
        large denominational church locally, confirmed this idea.
        He admitted that he usually hears about "secret sin" in
        His Body when the marriage is already over, or the
        surprise pregnancy has already taken place, etc. In our
        House Church, we encounter things on the front end, not
        the last gasp.
      </p>


      <p>
        Each person who responded to my question about
        "Spiritual Covering" agreed that there was no Biblical
        foundation for such a teaching, although many churches
        use this as a way to control their leaders and manage
        their "flock" by fear.
      </p>


      <p>
        Simply put, "Any church without spiritual covering
        is not, because of this fact, in error. However, if any
        church (with or without spiritual covering), believes or
        teaches or allows heretical ideas or doctrines or immoral
        activities to flourish, then that church is in error."
      </p>


      <p>
        I think one of the main things that came out of this
        larger discussion was the idea that spiritual accountability
        is Biblical, but spiritual covering is artificial, fear-based,
        man-made, and still not very effective in preventing
        doctrinal heresy or avoiding moral failures in the clergy.
      </p>


      <p>
        Most of us who have been around for while in the
        Christian Church can testify that our best systems of
        accountability do not prevent adultery, heresy,
        embezzlement, etc. We've probably all seen good, godly
        men and women fall hard. Sometimes the ones who fall
        are the very last people we would ever expect to fail in
        such a way. Nevertheless, they do, and often.
      </p>


      <p>
        As a former pastor, I have personally witnessed
        such failures over the last twenty years first-hand and it's
        never a pretty sight. Why do these things happen? Is it
        largely because we have elevated these leaders to an
        un-Biblical level? I would say, yes.
      </p>


      <p>
        Spiritual covering is not the same as
        accountability. When I spoke to Todd Hunter about this
        he had a great quote that I thought really expressed how
        arbitrary this idea of covering is. He said that if Rick
        Warren or Chuck Smith (or some other Christian with a
        celebrity status or a successful ministry, book, or radio
        show) were to announce today that they were leaving to
        start a brand-new house church, no one would dare ask
        them, "Who is your spiritual covering?" But if you or I (or
        some other "regular guy") were to hear God's call to start
        simple house church, then suddenly the question of
        "Spiritual Covering" arises. Suddenly it's just too
        dangerous to do this without another, higher spiritual
        authority looking out for things.
      </p>


      <p>
        The truth is, when Chuck Smith left the
        Foursquare denomination to start Calvary Chapel, he had
        no spiritual covering. When John Wimber left Calvary
        Chapel to launch the Vineyard Movement, he also had no
        spiritual covering. Does this mean that, to this very day,
        these large, international church-planting movements are
        without a spiritual covering? Yes, it does. Is that a
        problem? Not if you attend Calvary Chapel or a Vineyard
        church, and not if you reject the idea of "Covering"
        anyway.
      </p>


      <p>
        For that matter, when Martin Luther left the
        Catholic Church of his day and started a Protestant
        Reformation, he also had no "Spiritual Covering" either.
        So, I suppose there is no need to go much further than
        this.
      </p>


      <p>
        For me, it boils down to whether or not you are
        convinced that there is such a thing as "The Priesthood
        of The Believer" and how you define it. Scripturally, I
        believe, that every follower of Jesus is qualified to use
        their God-given spiritual gifts without the approval of a
        denominational leader or an organization. Basically, there
        is no need for a spiritual "go-between." We might need
        accountability, or discipling, or encouragement, or
        sometimes even rebuke from one another, but it is not
        necessary that we have a man, or an organization, to
        stand between us and God.
      </p>


      <p>
        A few years ago, some friends of mine wanted to
        start a Bible Study in their apartment. Because the lead
        pastor of the Church they were attending couldn't be
        there to oversee the study, they were not allowed to have
        their Bible Study. That is a prime example of the
        complete denial of the Priesthood of the Believer
        because "regular Christians" were not allowed to read the
        Bible on their own and understand it without the direct
        oversight of an official Church representative.
      </p>


      <p>
        We might as well trade in our modern English
        Bibles for Latin ones and apologize for the Reformation if
        that is how we feel about things.
      </p>


      <p>
        I realize that there are good people, sincere
        followers of Jesus who would disagree with me on this
        issue. I am not trying to argue or sling mud at anyone.
        However, it is my very strong opinion (and also,
        surprisingly, that of those distinguished gentlemen I
        surveyed earlier – smarter men than I, let us admit), that
        all that is needed for a Church to operate properly is to
        submit to one another, and to Christ, and to let the Word
        of God (the Bible) be your guide. The Holy Spirit
        promised (and I really do believe Him) to lead us into all
        Truth. We do not need an expert or a professional to tell
        us we are "safe" or "official.”
      </p>


      <p>
        We are The Body of Christ. We are The Church.
        The Bible is our Statement of Faith. We are accountable
        to one another and to The Holy Spirit of God. Jesus if our
        Head and He will build His Church just as He pleases (1
        Cor 12).
      </p>


      <p>
        <span class="quote">"A good man will remain faithful, even with a poor
          structure of accountability, and a degenerate man will
          frustrate and resist even the most iron-clad system of
          accountability,"</span> my friend Todd Hunter said to me. I must
        agree.
      </p>


      <p>
        I am happy to report that our House Church has
        accountability by the truck-load. I am accountable to
        every single person in our house church family. I am
        accountable to several other godly men with whom I am
        in constant relationship. I am also accountable to my wife
        and to my two sons.
      </p>


      <p>
        Even so, I have seen enough pastors fall into sin
        and self-deception and pride to know that no one is
        immune from moral or doctrinal failure. Accountability is
        essential. We must submit ourselves to God, and to our
        brothers and sisters in Christ, or we will never avoid the
        sin which so easily entangles.
