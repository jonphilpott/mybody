      <h1>About this Book</h1>
      <p>
        Keith Giles is part of a house church in Orange, California where no
        one takes a salary and all offerings are given to help the poor in
        the community. He has been a published writer since 1989. This is
        his third book. You can follow him online at www.KeithGiles.com
      </p>  
      <p> There is a radical differences between church as we know it,
        and <i>ekklesia</i> as God intended it. This book will challenge you
        to consider God's specific, New Testament design for the Body of
        Christ and how God's blueprint for a temple can only be fulfilled in
        the lives of His people.</p>

        "in this book Keith Giles presents us with the powerful example of
        his own life as he has dared to live out the prophetic insights he
        has discovered into the nature and mission of God's
        culture-challenging community. Read and gain courage to risk
        following his inspired and dynamic servant-leadership." - Dr Scott
        Bartchy, Professor of Christian Origins and the History of
        Relgion in the Department of History, UCLA

      <p class="bible">
        "Giles calls the church back from its preoccupation with business
        models and encourages believers to embrace spiritual relationships
        with one another and dependance on the Holy Spirit as we read
        about in Scripture." - Alan Knox, Doctoral Student, Biblical
        Theology.
