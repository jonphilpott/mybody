    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>
      I know that many who read this will find it hard to believe, but
      my inspiration for writing this book is founded in my love for
      the Church. Because of this love I cannot sit by silently and
      watch her wallow in her own complacency and ignorance. I cannot
      allow her to settle for less than all that her loving Creator
      has intended for her to experience. I cannot allow her to feast
      on the food she has scavenged from the spiritual dumpster when I
      can plainly see the table spread before her, filled with
      homemade delicacies freshly prepared and placed there for her
      sustenance
  
    </p>

<p>
The Church in the West is desperately in need of a
revival. She has languished for so long in the seat of
comfort and complacency that there is a desperate need
for her to be awakened, and refreshed, and renewed
from within. She has forsaken her calling. She has
forgotten her name. She has been seduced by the shiny
things of this fallen world and, worst of all, she has been
distracted to the point of forgetting her One true love.
</p>

<p>
In some ways this is a prophetic book. Not in the
sense that those who read it may learn the future, but
rather in the sense that, by reading it, one might
remember the past and return to the original path laid out
centuries before by God Himself. At least, this is my
dearest hope and prayer.
</p>

<p>
In the Old Testament, God raised up prophets to
remind the Nation of Israel who they were, and by what
means they had been saved from slavery and gathered
as a people. In the New Testament, Jesus came and
fulfilled the Messianic prophecy. He proclaimed the
coming of the Kingdom of God and lived a life that
demonstrated what citizens of the Kingdom should be
like. Today, I feel that we are desperate once again for a
prophetic word to shake us from our stupor and awaken
us from our slumber. Until those prophets appear, I hope
that this book may help us remember some of what
we’ve forgotten about who we are called to be.</p>

<p>
One of my favorite quotes is from A.W. Tozer who
said, <i>“We must not think of the Church as an anonymous
body, a mystical religious abstraction. We Christians are
the Church and whatever we do is what the Church is
doing. The matter, therefore, is a personal one. Any step
forward in the Church must begin with the individual.”</i><a class="fn" href="footnotes.html#introduction-1">1</a>
</p>
    
<p>
This means that, at the most fundamental level,
you and I are the Church. There is no way for us to talk
about the Church without essentially speaking about
ourselves, the followers of Jesus. Because of this, I
understand that any criticisms directed at the Church
may be painful to hear, however we must allow ourselves
to consider the truth, even if it hurts.
</p>

<p>
I pray that all of those who read this book may
extend to me an extra measure of grace as we navigate
these sensitive family issues. Please understand that I
am very much in love with Jesus. I am also very much
concerned about the well-being of the Church we are all
a part of. I do not hate the Church. I do not harbor any
grudges against any pastor. I do not have any anger in
my heart towards the Body and Bride of Christ. Indeed, it
is truly out of my passionate love for the Bride that I take
the time and energy to hold this mirror to her beautiful
face – The face that Jesus loved enough to die for – and
to help her cover the bruises, heal the wounds and make
herself ready for the Groom who is even now at the door.
</p>

<p>
If after reading this book you have any questions
or desire further interaction with me on a specific topic or
subject, I am happy to correspond with you and to
engage with you in this important dialog concerning the
Bride of Christ and God’s design for His Church.
</p>


<p>
Thank you for taking the time to read this book. I
hope and pray that God may use these ideas and
thoughts to prepare us all to be the Church that God
always dreamed of.
</p>

<p>
Sincerely,
</p>
