      <h1>We Are the Church</h1>

<p>
A good friend of mine once blurted out, "I hate
church." It took me by surprise at first, but I can totally
understand what my friend meant by that statement. He
means that he hates the way people operate in the
church, and that he's frustrated by the mentality of some
people who are confused about what church is meant to
be on this earth.
</p>


<p>
Honestly, whenever I see pastors manipulating
their flocks, or when I see Christians spending the bulk of
the offering on themselves, or when I see people twist
the ideas of service, worship and faith, I also feel anger. I
confess that there have been times when I have also
been tempted to say, "I hate church."
</p>


<p>
But, I've been very encouraged to consider the
words of A. W. Tozer on this subject when he reminds us
that we are not speaking of some anonymous
organization "out there" whenever we speak of "the
Church.” Instead, we are speaking about a living
organism we are inextricably connected to for eternity.
We <i>are</i> the Church. So, while we may hate certain
aspects of how our brothers and sisters operate, or how
people act within the Body, we are still speaking of
something that we are part of.
</p>


<p>
We are the Church. The only Church the world will
ever know. The only Church there will ever be.
So, now, let’s go and be the church we dream of.
</p>


<p>
If we want the Church to be more loving we must become
more loving. If we want the Church to be more
understanding and patient, we must become more
understanding and patient.
</p>


<p>
As we’ve already seen from 1 Peter chapter 2, as
we come to Jesus we are built up to become the people,
and the Church, He is building.
</p>


<p>
Notice, God is the one doing the building. He is
accomplishing all of this as He builds us up into the
people He wants us to be – A holy priesthood which
embodies the Spirit of God as a living temple.
</p>


<p>
I know it can seem very simplistic to consider this,
but all we have to do is to come to Jesus and allow Him
(by the power of His Holy Spirit) to build us up into the
people He has called and designed and intended for us
to be.
</p>


<p>
In our churches today we have relied too heavily
on ourselves, our own leaders, and our own ideas of
doing church. I believe that every Christian, whether
denominational or independent, charismatic or
conservative, must ask themselves this question: “Are we
truly relying on God for our health and existence or are
we relying on other people or things?”
</p>

<p>
As my friend Alan Knox points out, <span class="quote">“If removing
leadership or programs or buildings or finances or
anything else would cause believers to stop meeting
together, stop disciplining one another, stop growing
spiritually, then that group of believers is not depending
on God.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="quote">
For those of us who are leaders, this is an
especially important question. If the church would stop
functioning or growing if we disappeared, then there’s a
big problem. We are...building something that depends
on us, not on the Holy Spirit.
We may birth something on our own, and we may
keep something running on our own. But, only the Spirit
can birth and grow a church.”</span> <a class="fn" href="footnotes.html#section-3-2-18">18</a>

<h2>Church = God + the People of God</h2>


<p>
We've gotten into the bad habit of thinking that
Church equals a paid professional clergyman, and a
building that must be paid for and maintained, and a
strategy to attract people to fill the seats, etc. But none of
that is in the New Testament. It's not how Jesus modeled
Church for us. It's not how the Disciples and the Apostles
went about planting and growing Churches for nearly 400
years.
</p>


<p>
We have to stop trying to build the Church and
start being the Church.
</p>


<p>
Let Him build His Church. Be the Church and the
people He has called you to be.
