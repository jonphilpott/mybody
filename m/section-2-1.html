      <h1>Merely Followers</h1>
      
      <p class="bible">
        "(The Pharisees) do all their deeds to be seen by
        others...and they love the place of honor at feasts and
        the best seats in the synagogues and greetings in the
        marketplaces and being called rabbi by others," Jesus
        said to his disciples. "But you are not to be called rabbi,
        for you have one teacher, and you are all brothers."
        (Matt 23:5)
      </p>


      <p>
        These instructions from our Lord Jesus are all but
        forgotten in today's Church. The organizations that dot
        the fruited plains with His name over the door have not
        followed the advice of their founder when it comes to
        leadership.
      </p>


      <p>
        In fact, not only do we have numerous "rabbis"
        and "teachers" clogging the airwaves and bookshelves in
        our modern version of Christendom, we have also
        become obsessed with the concept of leadership in the
        Church. We have Leadership Conferences and
        Leadership Study Bibles and Leadership sections in our
        bookstores – all devoted to making us better leaders.
      </p>

      <p>

        With all this special attention placed on leadership
        and raising up leaders, it's almost as if we’re doing all we
        can to avoid the idea of being merely a follower. Our
        obsession with leadership suggests to everyone that to
        be a follower is to be pathetically average. To be a
        follower is to be lazy. Only those who lack ambition are
        just followers. It's only the serious Christians who desire
        to be successful and to be successful in the Body of
        Christ means being identified as a person with leadership
        skills and the potential to lead others.
      </p>


      <p>
        In our lust for position as leaders we've convinced
        ourselves that being a leader is part of fulfilling our
        command to make disciples and preach the Gospel to
        every creature. Yet we cannot truly make a disciple (a
        follower) unless we ourselves are also disciples and
        followers of Jesus. This means we must first become
        devoted to the idea of humbling ourselves daily, taking up
        our cross, and following Jesus before we dare to instruct
        someone else in this path.
      </p>


      <p>
        If our desire to lead is based on the idea that we're
        a better speaker or teacher than someone else, or if it's
        based on the feeling we get when people treat us like
        leaders, then we're in leadership for the wrong reasons.
        I can remember being at Pastor’s conferences where the
        idea of being seen as a great leader in the eyes of all the
        other great leaders was the only thing on anyone's mind,
        including my own.
      </p>


      <p>
        All the posturing, the off-hand remarks about the
        size of my church or the casual references to the
        innovative approach we were taking to ministry were all
        calculated to raise my stature in the eyes of the other
        pastors in the room.
      </p>


      <p>
        It didn't seem so bad to me at the time because
        everyone else was behaving the same way. Today I
        realize there's more to leadership than being perceived
        as the one with all the answers and I fully repent of this
        self-centered pursuit of man's approval.
      </p>


      <p>
        Our ultimate model for leadership is Jesus. He
        demonstrated a leadership style that flies in the face of
        our popular ideas of what it means to be a leader. Jesus
        laid aside his great authority and power and humbled
        himself from the very beginning, taking on the role of a
        servant, making himself nothing. Our attitude should be
        the same. (See Philippians chapter 2).
      </p>


      <p>
        Even in the House Church Movement we have
        started to fall into this leadership-centric mindset with
        authors and experts being sought after to speak at large
        conferences around the country. We're beginning to
        create our very own house church celebrities now, and
        this troubles me. If there's anything our movement can
        contribute to the Church as a whole it's the concept that
        everyone matters, not just the leaders among us who
        instruct and guide us.
      </p>


      <p>
        Jesus was the one who told his disciples that the
        one who wants to be the leader has to be willing to wash
        feet, and serve others and above all to put the needs of
        others ahead of their own.
      </p>


      <p class="bible">
        "The greatest among you shall be your servant,"
        Jesus said. "Whoever exalts himself will be
        humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be
        exalted." (Matt 23:5-12)
      </p>


      <p>
        It may not be popular to merely follow Jesus
        today, but it's the main thing each of us is called to be – a
        humble follower of Jesus who teaches others how to
        humbly follow Jesus too.
      </p>


      <h2>WHERE ARE THE PASTORS?</h2>

      <p>
        Where are all the Pastors in the New Testament?
        Why are they absent if they are so crucial to the life of the
        Body? Why is the word only used once in the entire New
        Testament? Why are no letters addressed to them from
        the Apostles? Why are the Elders (plural) the main form
        of leadership we see in the New Testament? What were
        the qualifications necessary to be an Elder or an
        Overseer? What do these words even mean?
      </p>

      <p>

        First of all, there is no direct correlation in the New
        Testament to our modern pastors. None. The word only
        appears once in the New Testament and it is never
        unpacked adequately for us to understand exactly what a
        pastor did. However we can extrapolate based on the
        root of the word which means "to shepherd.” Therefore,
        pastors were to shepherd the flock and care for them,
        spiritually. Beyond that we have no other instructions
        regarding a pastor.
      </p>


      <p>
        Make no mistake, the leaders of the early church
        were not the pastors. The most common of all of the New
        Testament references to leaders are either "elders" or
        "overseers" and the two are used almost interchangeably
        throughout the epistles. The term "elders" applies to
        those who were "old" or "mature". Essentially they were
        to be followed because they were wise and they
        deserved respect. The "overseers" were simply those
        who helped to "oversee" or "facilitate" the gatherings of
        believers.
      </p>


      <p>
        From what we see in the New Testament, every
        church had more than one elder and numerous
        overseers who helped to guide the church and lead them
        to follow Christ.
      </p>


      <p>
        It's fascinating to me that the letters to the
        Churches in the New Testament are never addressed to
        the leaders directly, but instead to the Church as a whole.
      </p>


      <p>
        Certainly there are a few exceptions. Some letters
        are written directly to people like Timothy or Philemon.

      </p>

      <p>
        Although many pastors assume that Timothy is an
        example of a Biblical pastor, in actuality Timothy was
        engaged in work similar to that of Paul who was busy
        travelling and preaching the Gospel and planting
        churches. Timothy is told by Paul to "do the work of an
        evangelist" – not a pastor. Timothy certainly didn't stay in
        one place and teach the same people week after week,
        except in this one case where Paul asked him to do so.
      </p>


      <p>
        Therefore, Timothy is an example of an evangelist
        or apostle, not a pastor as we might know one today.
      </p>


      <p>
        The church in Corinth is a fascinating example of a
        church with numerous moral and ethical failures, yet
        when Paul writes to correct them he doesn't address their
        pastor and command him to fix things. In fact, he doesn't
        even address their elders or overseers to respond to this
        by exercising their authority over the people. Why were
        the pastors, or for that matter the elders of the church,
        not commanded to exercise their authority and deal with
        the very serious moral failures within the Church in
        Corinth? Perhaps because Paul understood that the
        Body itself was capable of coming together to correct the
        problem themselves. Something he hints at when he
        says, <span class="quote">"Do you not know that we will judge angels? How
          much more matters of this life?" (1 Corinthians 6:3) </span>
      </p>


      <h2>A DIFFERENT KIND OF SUBMISSION</h2>

      <p>
        I would like to humbly suggest that "Authority", and
        "Submission" do not necessarily imply organizational
        structures are at work in the New Testament Church.
        Submission is something that all believers are urged to
        do, and authority is only to be submitted to if it is in line
        with God’s Word and not on the basis of an office or
        appointment.
      </p>


      <p class="bible">
        "Submit to one another out of reverence for
        Christ." (Ephesians 5:21)
      </p>


      <p>
        Everyone is urged to submit to everyone else. It's
        a shared submission among brothers and sisters in
        Christ who are equals and who humbly care for one
        another. Only Christ is the head, or the leader, of the
        Church.
      </p>


      <p>
        Many are of the opinion that Jesus actually taught
        and promoted hierarchy in the Church, something I find
        alarming and dangerous. But, just for a moment, let me
        ask, "What would we expect to see in the New Testament
        if Jesus didn’t want His Church to be run like a
        hierarchy?”
      </p>


      <p>
        Wouldn't we expect to see Jesus condemning this
        practice? Perhaps he would have pointed to a
        hierarchical system and commanded His disciples not to
        follow that example?
      </p>


      <p class="bible">
        "Jesus called them together and said, ‘You know
        that those who are regarded as rulers of the
        Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials
        exercise authority over them. Not so with you.
        Instead, whoever wants to become great among
        you must be your servant, and whoever wants to
        be first must be slave of all. For even the Son of
        Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and
        to give his life as a ransom for many.’” (Mk.10:42-
        45)
      </p>


      <p>
        Does Jesus command his disciples not to exercise
        authority over people? Yes, he clearly and plainly does.
        What, then, are today's pastors doing if they are not
        exercising their authority over their church members?
        Isn't this a fair question to ask? Am I allowed to point out
        the disconnect between what Jesus says and what His
        Church actually does, or does not, do?
      </p>


      <p>
        Here, in the Gospel of Mark, Jesus points to the
        Roman Government (a secular hierarchy) and
        commands his disciples not to imitate this system of
        lording it over people or exercising authority over those
        who follow.
      </p>


      <p>
        In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus points to a
        religious system of hierarchy and instructs them (again)
        not to imitate this system of hierarchy where the
        "Teacher" is exalted over the student. Instead, he says,
        remember that you are all brethren:
      </p>


      <p class="bible">
        "But you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' for you have
        only one Master and you are all brothers. And do
        not call anyone on earth 'father,' for you have one
        Father, and he is in heaven. Nor are you to be
        called 'teacher,' for you have one Teacher, the
        Christ. The greatest among you will be your
        servant. For whoever exalts himself will be
        humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be
        exalted." (Matt. 23:8-12)
      </p>


      <p>
        Next, let's look at the Apostles themselves. If they
        heard Jesus commanding them to avoid the hierarchical
        system of leadership, wouldn't we see evidence that they
        obeyed this command? Did they take his words to heart?
        Let's see:
      </p>


      <p>
        "Not that we lord it over your faith, but we work
        with you for your joy, because it is by faith you
        stand firm." (2 Cor.1:24)
      </p>


      <p>
        Paul the Apostle obeys Jesus and refuses to "lord
        it over" those who follow Christ alongside him. Instead he
        works with them, as a brother, not as an authority figure.
      </p>


      <p>
        "To the elders among you, I appeal as a fellow
        elder, a witness of Christ's sufferings and one who
        also will share in the glory to be revealed: Be
        shepherds of God's flock that is under your care,
        serving as overseers—not because you must, but
        because you are willing, as God wants you to be;
        not greedy for money, but eager to serve; not
        lording it over those entrusted to you, but being
        examples to the flock. And when the Chief
        Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of
        glory that will never fade away."(1 Peter 5:1-4)
      </p>


      <p>
        Here, Peter identifies himself, not as an Apostle,
        but as a fellow elder among the brethren. He then urges
        these elders (plural) to serve as overseers because they
        are willing, not because they have been handed a title or
        an appointment, and especially urges them to be careful
        not to "lord it over those entrusted to you, but being
        examples to the flock" – as Jesus commanded him
        several years earlier.
      </p>

      <p>
        Having said all of this, doesn't the New Testament
        ask that we submit to our leaders? Yes, it does. For
        example:
      </p>


      <p>
        "Obey your leaders and submit to their authority.
        They keep watch over you as men who must give
        an account. Obey them so that their work will be a
        joy, not a burden, for that would be of no
        advantage to you." (Hebrews 13: 17)
      </p>


      <p>
        This passage in Hebrews above suffers from a
        horrible translation of the original Greek. The word
        “authority” is not in the text. “Let yourself be persuaded
        by your leaders” is a better wording of the passage.
        Therefore, we are to be submissive to the humble, Godly
        leadership of those within the Body as it is applied for our
        spiritual edification and development.
      </p>


      <p>
        Let me be clear, I am not arguing against
        leadership here. Not at all. Every church needs
        leadership, and this is also clearly taught in the New
        Testament. However I would like to ask us to consider
        the possibility that leadership doesn't automatically mean
        top-down, authoritarianism. Jesus modeled something
        different than this, and then he commanded his disciples
        to emulate his example.
      </p>


      <p>
        So, going back to our verse above, you might read
        this and ask, "What is the basis for our submission to our
        leaders?" Does their authority rest in the office they hold,
        or is it found in something else? Are we to submit to
        these leaders only because they hold an office? Or are
        we to submit to them as they point us to follow Christ?
        Hopefully we do not blindly follow people because they
        are "the Pastor" or because they have a title of authority.
      </p>


      <p>
        No, the only authority we are to submit to is Christ
        Himself. To me, this truth is self-evident when we look at
        the New Testament as a whole.
      </p>


      <p>
        Earlier in this same chapter, the writer of Hebrews,
        in chapter 13 and verse 7 says, <span class="quote">"Remember your
          leaders, who spoke the word of God to you. Consider the
          outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith."</span>
      </p>


      <p>
        Here we are told to submit to our leaders as they
        speak the Word of God to us. Not to them as authorities
        in and of themselves, but as humble servants who
        lovingly teach us to follow Christ, and who then
        demonstrate this by their actual lives of faith.
      </p>


      <p>
        Submission then is to Christ and to the Word of
        God. If our leaders handle and teach the Word of God
        wisely, and if they faithfully live lives that reflect Christ,
        then we are to submit to their instruction. But only if.
        Submission is not based on any authority held by one in
        an office or position. Otherwise, we would be
        accountable to obey leaders simply because they held
        that office, regardless of whether or not their lives
        reflected Christ or their teaching of God's Word was true.
      </p>


      <p>
        If we follow the policy of hierarchy for the sake of
        itself we can end up with someone holding an office
        within the Church and exercising authority even if they
        are not followers of Christ. Such a person should have no
        actual authority in any spiritual sense over the life of
        believers. What counts is character, not the office or the
        position. However, someone with no organizational office
        may, because of gifting by the Holy Spirit and sincere
        love for others, have actual authority to speak and teach
        and lead his brothers and sisters in Christ (who are his
        equals).
      </p>


      <p>
        Institutional Churches that employ a man-made
        organizational method can only hope to mimic the kind of
        leadership such as the "rulers of the gentiles" possess,
        something that Jesus expressly commanded us not to
        do, saying <span class="quote">"It shall not be so among you!" (Matthew
          20:25-26)</span>
      </p>


      <p>
        The Holy Spirit is the only source of spiritual
        authority and accountability in the Church through real-
        life relationships, not titles handed down by men.
      </p>


      <p>
        Did the Apostles depend upon the authority of
        men or did they give any weight to the opinions of men?
        Apparently they did not. For example, Paul says, "Are we
        beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need,
        like some people, letters of recommendation to you or
        from you? You yourselves are our letter, written on our
        hearts, known and read by everybody." (2 Cor. 3:1-2)
      </p>


      <p>
        If hierarchy was so important in the early church,
        why don't we see them exercising it? Why do we see
        them operating as a Body and not as a business?
        Perhaps the answers are right in front of us? Are we
        courageous enough to answer truthfully?
      </p>


      <p>
        Richard Halverson famously said, <span class="quote">"When the
          Greeks got the Gospel, they turned it into a philosophy;
          when the Romans got it, they turned it into a government;
          when the Europeans got it, they turned it into a culture;
          and when the Americans got it, they turned it into a
          business."<a class="fn" href="footnotes.html#section-2-1-16">16</a></span>
      </p>


      <p>
        I pray that God's people would see that they were
        never intended to be run like a business, and instead
        that, according to the Word of God, they are simply a
        Family, a Body, an Organism, and a Bride.
      </p>


      <h2>What Is An Apostle?</h2>

      <p>
        As I've been studying the early church the
        question came to me, "Where did the word 'Apostle'
        come from?" Looking at the New Testament the word
        simply appears out of nowhere as the twelve disciples
        are suddenly, without explanation, referred to as
        apostles. I started to wonder, "What was the origin of this
        word? What did it mean to those first century followers of
        Jesus who heard the word? Was it foreign or strange to
        them? Did it carry the same meaning for them that it does
        for us today?"
      </p>


      <p>
        The word “Apostle” comes from the Ancient
        Greek, <span class="quote">"apostolos,"</span> which is translated as "someone sent
        out," or "missionary."
      </p>

      <p>
        According to Walter Bauer's Greek-English
        Lexicon of the NT: "Judaism had an office known as
        apostle." The Friberg Greek Lexicon gives a broad
        definition as one who is sent on a mission, a
        commissioned representative of a congregation, a
        messenger for God, a person who has the special task of
        founding and establishing churches. The UBS Greek
        Dictionary also describes an apostle broadly as a
        “messenger.”
      </p>

      <p>
        With this we can understand a little more about
        how the early church viewed the apostles. They were
        church-planting missionaries who preached the Gospel of
        the Kingdom and continued the ministry of Jesus, the
        Messiah.
      </p>


      <p>
        When we look at the New Testament we see
        plenty of evidence to support this. Peter, James, John,
        Paul and the other apostles were primarily concerned
        with traveling to share the Gospel, plant churches and
        establish a framework for what it meant to be a follower
        of Jesus.
      </p>


      <p>
        Christians today seem to hold the apostolic gifting
        as one above and beyond the common persons of
        Christendom. Many even go so far as to suggest that
        there are no apostles in today's church, which is to say
        that there are no longer church planters or missionaries
        who are called by God to evangelize the nations and
        establish the Church of God in the community.
      </p>


      <p>
        When we read passages like Ephesians 4, verse
        11-13 with this in mind it should give us a new
        perspective on the term "apostle" and the way the early
        church thought of these people within the Body itself:-
      </p>


      <p class="bible">
        "It was he (Jesus) who gave some to be apostles,
        some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and
        some to be pastors and teachers, to prepare
        God's people for works of service, so that the body
        of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in
        the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God
        and become mature, attaining to the whole
        measure of the fullness of Christ."
      </p>


      <p>
        Apostles (church-planting missionaries) were
        necessary to communicate the Gospel of the Kingdom
        and establish the Church in Jerusalem, and Samaria, and
        the uttermost parts of the Earth. They were "first" in a
        chronological sense because, unless there is someone to
        go out and preach the Gospel and do the work of an
        evangelist or missionary, the Church couldn't be
        established. Once the Gospel is preached, people
        respond, groups are formed and the Church is
        established within a community, then the Holy Spirit
        provides for some to become their teachers, their
        shepherds, and to do the works of service.
      </p>


      <h2>NOT A HIERARCHY</h2>

      <p>
        I've spent a lot of energy defending the idea that
        the early church had no hierarchical form of leadership as
        we know it today. As we begin to see a more practical
        image of an apostle as a church-planting missionary, this
        further solidifies the assertion that hierarchy wasn't part
        of the original Christian experience.
      </p>


      <p>
        This is why we see Jesus commanding the
        disciples (and future apostles) not to be like the secular
        Romans or the religious Pharisees who love to "lord it
        over" their followers. Instead, Jesus both commanded
        and modeled a bottom-up form of servant leadership, not
        a top-down form of CEO leadership.
      </p>


      <h2>MORE THAN 12 APOSTLES</h2>
      <p>
        Another surprising discovery in the New
        Testament is that the apostles are not limited to just "The
        Twelve" we usually hear about on Sunday morning.
        These additional Apostles (or "Missionary Church-
        planters") include Barnabas (Acts 14:14), Andronicus and
        Junia (Romans 16:7), Silas and Timothy (I Thessalonians
        1:1; 2:6, Acts 15:40), and Apollos (1Corinthians 4:6; 4:9;
        3:22; 3:4-6).
      </p>


      <p>
        It's quite fascinating also to consider that many
        scholars confirm the strongest evidence that the apostle
        Junia was female (see Romans 16:7) which gives further
        weight to the idea that the apostolic gifting was simply
        about doing missionary work and planting churches, not
        about authority or hierarchy.
      </p>


      <p>
        Even more interesting is that Jesus himself is
        named among the apostles in Hebrews 3:1 where he is
        referred to as the "apostle and high priest of our
        professed faith.” In this passage Jesus is identified as the
        first missionary church-planter who called the twelve
        disciples to follow him so that he could teach them to be
        "fishers of men.”
      </p>


      <p>
        While there is a special and unique connection
        between the original twelve disciples who walked and
        talked with Jesus personally, and even Paul who
        encountered the risen Christ in a vision, the actual
        functional position of an apostle is no more important or
        special than any other spiritual gift or function within the
        Body.
      </p>


      <p>
        The Apostles were very simply and practically the
        ones who did the work of missionary evangelism and
        planted churches, and God is still calling His people to be
        missionaries into the community and plant churches that
        interact with the culture.
      </p>


      <p>
        Apostolic succession, then, is simply a
        continuation of the traditional preaching of the Gospel of
        the Kingdom, making disciples, planting churches within
        the community and raising up others who will continually
        do the same.
      </p>


      <h2>The Myth of the Pastoral Epistles</h2>

      <p>
        The letters of Paul to Timothy, and the book of
        Titus (and sometimes Philemon) are commonly referred
        to as the Pastoral Epistles of Paul the Apostle.
        Never mind that these are not written to Pastors.
        Never mind that Timothy is, like Paul, a travelling
        missionary and church-planting evangelist. Never mind
        that Titus is also not a pastor but has been "left behind in
        Crete" to help establish a church community there before
        he moves on to plant other churches elsewhere. Never
        mind that Philemon isn't anything other than a slave-
        owner who needs encouragement from Paul regarding
        treatment of said slave. Never mind that both of the
        epistles to Timothy and the one to Titus deal primarily
        with the character of elders (plural) within the church
        community. Never mind that the word "Pastor" does not
        appear in any of these so-called "Pastoral Epistles.”
        Never mind that the word "Pastor" only appears once in
        the entire New Testament, and then it is in the plural.
      </p>


      <p>
        As long as you can overlook all of these minor
        details, you should have no problem referring to these as
        the “Pastoral Epistles” of Paul.
      </p>


      <h2> What Does It Mean To Be A Minister? </h2>
      <p>
        The definition of the world "minister" from the
        original Greek, according to Strong's Concordance:
      </p>


      <p class="bible">
        "One who executes the commands of another,
        esp. of a master, a servant, attendant, minister."
        1a) the servant of a king; 1b) a deacon, one who,
        by virtue of the office assigned to him by the
        church, cares for the poor and has charge of and
        distributes the money collected for their use; 1c) a
        waiter, one who serves food and drink.
      </p>


      <p>
        It’s fascinating that most think of a Minister as the
        power-tie wearing, spiritual authority figure and CEO of
        the local Christian franchise.
      </p>


      <p>
        Wouldn't it be awesome if pastors and ministers
        simply loved and served people because it was what God
        called them to do and not because they were being paid
        handsomely?
      </p>


      <p>
        As I’ve been exploring spiritual gifts and how God
        uses them in the Body, I've realized that all spiritual gifts
        are for the benefit of others, not ourselves. The gift to
        shepherd is intended to provide spiritual care for the rest
        of the Body, not a position of authority and power to be
        "Lorded over" the people of God.
      </p>


      <p>
        If being a shepherd is a gift from God, like the
        spiritual gift of encouragement or administration or
        speaking in tongues, this means that a twelve year old
        girl could have the gift to pastor or shepherd others.
        It also means that one could attend seminary and
        command a high salary at a mega-church and not have
        the gift to pastor at all.
      </p>


      <p>
        God gives this gift to His people in order to make
        sure they are cared for and loved and are spiritually
        healthy, not so that some can be the center of attention
        at the expense of others.
      </p>


      <p>
        Most of us, when we think of the word "Pastor" get
        a mental image of a guy in a suit who stands up on the
        big stage each Sunday and gives a long, power-pointed
        speech right after the offering plate is passed. But, that is
        not what Biblical pastoring is about at all.
      </p>


      <p>
        Even though the New Testament is largely silent
        on the subject, our churches today have made the pastor
        the single most important position within the Body of
        Christ.
      </p>


      <p>
        As John H. Yoder points out, <span class="quote">"There are few more
          reliable constants running through all human society than
          the special place every human community makes for the
          professional religionist . . . in every case he disposes a
          unique quality, which he usually possesses for life, which
          alone qualifies him for his function, and beside which the
          mass of men are identifiable negatively as “laymen,” i.e.,
          non-bearers of this special quality . . . One person per
          place is enough to do what he needs to do . . . the
          clergyman mediates between the common life and the
          realm of the “invisible” or the “spiritual” . . . No one balks
          at what his services cost.”</span> <a class="fn" href="footnotes.html#section-2-1-17">17</a>
      </p>


      <p>
        To be sure, God does provide people within the
        Body of Christ to help shepherd or pastor us. However,
        our mental pictures of this function are way off base. We
        picture a CEO in a power tie, but the Scriptures suggest
        a simple person who knows how to wash feet.
      </p>


      <p>
        The word "Minister" implies one who serves, and
        yet in our society we've made the position into a
        professional office where all authority and power,
        prestige and wisdom flow down from on high.
      </p>


      <p>
        Jesus modeled something so much greater for us
        when he put on the robes of a slave and knelt down to
        wash the feet of his disciples. He served them. The
        scriptures say that, He expressed the "fullness of his
        love" to them in this simple act of service and humility.
        What's more, when he was finished he sat down
        and asked them, <span class="quote">"Do you know what I have done for
          you?"</span> He wanted them to understand the importance of
        serving one another, not "Lording it over" their subjects
        as the Pharisees were known to do.
      </p>


      <p>
        If we're honest, most of what passes for Pastoral
        leadership today looks a whole lot more like the "Lording
        it over" process modeled by the Pharisees than it does
        like the "putting on the robe of a servant" as Jesus did.
      </p>


      <p>
        Honestly, the shepherd is simply one who has
        been gifted by the Holy Spirit to serve others. God is the
        One who calls people and then gives them the spiritual
        gift of a pastor. This means that you could go to seminary
        and get a degree, but still not have the genuine spiritual
        gift of a pastor, or shepherd, in God’s family.
      </p>


      <p>
        It also means you could be a teenager or a house
        wife and have a greater spiritual gift to lovingly shepherd
        your brothers and sisters in the Body than the guy who is
        standing behind the pulpit in the suit and tie with the
        seminary degree on the wall.
      </p>


      <p>
        True shepherding means dying to yourself. It
        means giving up your time in order to meet with people
        who are in crisis. It means long hours in prayer for your
        dear brothers and sisters in Christ. It sometimes means
        helping them to repent, or to ask forgiveness. It means
        helping them make sense of their pain, or their loss. It
        means speaking truth to them even though they might
        hate you for it. It means standing aside and being silent
        in order to allow them to speak and to soar and to utilize
        the spiritual gifting that God has placed within them. It
        means rejoicing when they are honored in the assembly.
      </p>


      <p>
        This is what it means to be a pastor in God’s
        house. It means to serve, to minister to others, to
        shepherd people, and to love them so much that you're
        willing to do what's best for them, even if it kills you.
      </p>
