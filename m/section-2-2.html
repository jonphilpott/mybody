      <h1>Can Women Be Leaders In the Church?</h1>

<p>
Some are convinced that there are New
Testament scriptures which prohibit a woman to act as a
leader within the Body. Before we take a look at those
verses more closely I would like to remind everyone of
the fact that women played a very important role in the
ministry of Jesus.
</p>


<p>
His most powerful interactions, healings and
teachings involve women (the woman at the well, the
woman caught in adultery, the woman with the issue of
blood, the woman whose son had died, the woman who
anointed his feet with her tears and dried them with her
hair, the woman who broke the box of perfume over his
feet, etc.) and women supported his ministry, watched
him die, attended his grave and gave witness to his
resurrection from the dead.
</p>


<p>
Jesus honored women in a culture where women
were undervalued and equal to children and unbelievers.
Often they were treated more as property than as people.
</p>


<h2>WHAT PAUL SAYS</h2>

<p>
Now, let's see what Paul really had to say about
this subject and, beyond that, what he meant to teach us
about the role that women play in the Body.
</p>



<p>
In 1 Timothy 2:12 Paul says:

</p>

<p class="bible">
"I do not permit a woman to teach or to have
authority over a man; she must be silent."
</p>


<p>
As with all difficult teachings and doctrine, we
have to take the consensus of other scriptures on the
subject in order to get a clear picture of what is actually
being said and taught.
</p>


<p>
While Paul’s statement here appears to be the
final word on the matter, we have to remember that
elsewhere Paul also teaches that a woman should cover
her head when she prophesies. (1 Corinthians 11:4-5)
</p>


<p>
What's going on here? In one verse Paul says that
he doesn't allow a woman to speak and he doesn't allow
a woman to teach, yet in this passage he's providing
guidelines for how a woman should prophesy in the
gathering of believers.
</p>


<p>
Let me remind you that, to Paul, the gift of
prophecy is one of the greatest "leadership" gifts in the
entire Body (see 1 Corinthians 14: 1-5). Doesn't one who
prophesies speak to the entire Body and provide a
message from God for their edification and
strengthening?
</p>


<p>
How do we reconcile these seemingly
contradictory ideas regarding Paul's vision of Church?
Women are allowed to prophesy as long as their heads
are covered, and yet they are called to keep silent.
What's going on?
</p>


<p>
In my opinion, there are a few things going on
here. First, Paul says one thing to the Church in Corinth
because he is addressing some very specific issues they
are facing in their fellowship together. This means that
when he writes to Timothy and he gives a different set of
guidelines he is attempting to correct a different set of
behaviors within a different Body of believers.
</p>


<p>
Simply put, the church where Timothy was serving
didn't face the same problems as the church in Corinth.
Therefore Paul's advice to one was not the same as what
was given to the other.
</p>


<p>
Also, Paul often says certain controversial things
and he attaches a qualifier like, <span class="quote">"I am saying this, and not
the LORD..."</span> as he does in 1 Corinthians 7:12, <span class="quote">"But to the
rest I, not the Lord, say, If any brother has a wife who
does not believe, and she is willing to be with him, let him
not divorce her."</span>
</p>


<p>
In passages like this Paul seems to be aware of
certain opinions that he might hold that may, or may not,
be necessarily a hard line teaching from God.
</p>


<p>
With this in mind, I think it's interesting that in our
original passage (1 Tim 2:11-12), Paul says, <span class="quote">"I do not
allow a woman to teach or to have authority over a
man..,."</span> and in my mind this leaves room for us to wonder
out loud about whether or not Paul intended this teaching
to be taken as "from the Lord" or from Paul's personal
bag of wisdom. Some scholars have pointed out that for
Paul to add the qualifier, “I do not allow” he was admitting
that other Apostles in the Church at this time did allow it.
</p>

<p>

Furthermore, other scholars have made note that
the passage, in the Greek, actually is better translated as
“I am not now allowing,” which suggests that Paul may
have been speaking to a special circumstance that
needed to be addressed. At any rate, I believe Paul
leaves room for us to disagree with him in these matters
of cultural preference regarding the role of women within
the gathering. I want to stress, however, that we do not
have that same privilege when Paul leaves off that
qualifier, "I, not the Lord.”
</p>


<h2>WOMEN AS DEACONS, ELDERS AND LEADERS</h2>

<p>
Paul writes in Timothy and in Titus to provide
criteria for an elder, and an overseer within the Body. In
those passages he centers on the male gender, calling
for them to be "Husbands of one wife", etc.
</p>


<p>
However, the New Testament also includes great
evidence that the early church had many women
deacons. Paul speaks of a deaconess named Phoebe in
Romans 16:1 and also mentions Priscilla and Aquila in
verse 2 calling them "my fellow workers in Christ Jesus".
These two are also prominent in Paul's ministry, even
traveling with him on Missionary journey's in Acts 18:18,
and we know that the two of them hosted a church in
their home according to 1 Corinthians 16:19. (Paul also
mentions Euodia and Syntyche in Philipians 4, as well as
Tabitha or Dorcas in Acts 9.)
</p>


<p>
There also seems to be a difference between the
roles of elders and overseers as it pertains to the
gathering of the assembly versus the life of the Church
outside the meeting. Women are welcome to share
among the rest of the people who gather to share and
worship in the 1 Corinthians 12 model. However, the
authority required to rebuke or confront a believer caught
in sin seems to rest on those male elders and overseers
who were recognized as having a Fatherly position within
the Body.
