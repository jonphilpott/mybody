      <h1>Can We Improve on Jesus?</h1>

      <p>
        As someone who makes a living as a copywriter
        for a large technology distribution company, I'm familiar
        with big business strategies and the rules of marketing.
        Over the years, I've attended seminars and workshops
        and sat through corporate sponsored tutorials on image,
        branding, messaging and the ABC's of marketing based
        on how humans behave, how they react, and what they
        respond to.
      </p>


      <p>
        Of course, as I've read and studied and discussed
        these concepts on a professional level, it's easy to see
        how someone in the church might want to take
        advantage of these ideas in order to attract more
        attendees on Sunday morning. Why not? If we know that
        people today like this or prefer that, then what's wrong
        with giving them what they want so that we can grow the
        church?
      </p>


      <p>
        Perhaps because, as I have already mentioned,
        these methods are really all about manipulation. Perhaps
        it's also because utilizing these methods blurs the actual,
        intended purpose of the Church itself.
      </p>


      <p>
        Jesus did not command us to gather large crowds
        of people. Good Marketing can help you attract and keep
        a crowd, but that's not what being a Christian, or
        following Jesus, is all about.

        At a conference for Data Capture and Point of
        Sale vendors and resellers Janet Schijns of Motorola
        said, <span class="quote">"You cannot achieve tomorrow's results with
          yesterday's methods."</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        From a business perspective this makes sense.
        Things change and in order to continue to remain
        profitable it's necessary to keep up with the changing
        trends and latch onto the most cutting edge technologies
        available. This works for big biz, but does it work in the
        Church?
      </p>

      <p>
        Well, for one thing success in the world of big
        business is about selling things. It's not about making
        friends or loving people or serving others or coming
        alongside the poor or the lonely or the broken. It's not
        about teaching people how to follow Jesus. Big business
        defines success as making money, and lots of it, as fast
        as possible and at the expense of the business down the
        street from you.
      </p>


      <p>
        Success in the big business world is about
        competition. It's about growing your profits. It's about
        money.
      </p>


      <p>
        Sadly, the Christian Church in America has
        decided that success for them is also about competition
        with the church down the street and about growing larger
        and making more money. But, if we scan the New
        Testament we can plainly see that this isn't what Jesus
        had in mind for His Church.
      </p>


      <p>
        The major disconnect is that the Church was
        never meant to be run like a business. The Church,
        according to the New Testament, is a relational army of
        servants who give and share and love those around
        them. It is a family, a bride, an organism and a body. It is
        a living, breathing, loving, giving, serving representation
        of Jesus on this earth.
      </p>


      <p>
        Was Jesus concerned with competition? Did he
        affirm his disciples when they chased away someone
        who was healing in his name, or did he rebuke them for
        that behavior?
      </p>

      <p>
        Was Jesus concerned with money? Or did he
        celebrate both the widow's mite and the harlot's
        extravagant alabaster expression of love?
      </p>


      <p>
        Was Jesus concerned with attracting large
        crowds? Or did he do his best to thin the crowds? Did he
        retreat to the mountains to be alone? Did he guard his
        time with his disciples and pour his life into a few?
      </p>

      <p>
        The quote from Motorola's executive may work for
        big business, but in the Church if we abandon the
        example of Jesus and the patterns of the early church in
        favor of a more business-savvy approach we are in effect
        improving on Jesus. Is that even possible? Can we
        improve Jesus?

      </p>

      <p>
        As a contrast to the quote above let me suggest
        that if we really hope to enjoy the fruit that the original
        Christians experienced in the book of Acts we must plant
        and water and nurture as they did. I would suggest that if
        we want what they had we will have to do what they did.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let me respectfully suggest an alternate take on
        this quote for the church: "You can’t achieve yesterday’s
        results with today's methods."
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead I see pastors beating their heads against
        the wall trying this method or that program to achieve the
        community and the discipleship and the passion for
        Christ that they see in the book of Acts. They continually
        attempt to get what the Acts Christians had without trying
        to do what they did.
      </p>

      <p>
        I call this BBQ Waffles because it's like trying to
        duplicate someone's waffle recipe by reading and
        following the advice of gourmet BBQ chefs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Big business executives know how to make
        money and increase profits and beat the competition.
        They do not know how to teach people to love or to serve
        or to give or to share and they most especially do not
        know how to teach people how to follow Jesus in their
        everyday life.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I look at the early church I am amazed at
        how they remained committed to Jesus and to His
        teachings of servant hood, love for others, radical
        compassion for the poor and non-violence.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's amazing to me that for over 300 years they
        continued to hold fast to the example of Jesus who
        forgave his executioners and prayed for his torturers and
        went like a lamb to the slaughter.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even when it appeared that it wasn't working, they
        never gave up on Jesus or His teachings. Even as their
        property was confiscated they held on tight to the
        teachings of Jesus. Even when they were thrown to the
        flames or put to death in the lion's den, they never shrank
        back from the values of the Kingdom or the Gospel of
        Christ.
      </p>

      <p>
        At least, that is, until it appeared that they had won
        the victory. Once Constantine declared himself to be a
        Christian and offered them a chance to trade their
        suffering for leisure and their outcast status for popularity,
        they blinked. They settled for the best the Empire could
        give them and they let go of the radical doctrine of Jesus.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today many who call themselves "Christians" are
        still unable to let go of their status. They're still unwilling
        to lay down their considerable resources to embrace the
        simple teaching of Jesus.
      </p>

      <h2>How Different Are We?</h2>

      <p>
        The Christians in Acts shared all things. The
        Christians in Acts sold their possessions and gave it to
        the poor. The Christians in Acts took their land and their
        property and liquidated them so that others could be fed
        and clothed. Their hope was in Jesus alone. Their trust
        was in the truth of His teachings.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Church today is afraid of losing Her tax
        exemption status. The Church today will not sell her
        property and give the money to the poor. The Church
        today does not consider the offering as belonging to the
        poor but as belonging to the Church. Today’s Church is
        often more concerned about the world of politics than in
        the conditions of the poor in the community.

      </p>

      <p>
        Our hope is in our political influence. Our trust is in
        American Democracy and the power of our vote.
      </p>

      <p>
        I fear that the Church today has become the polar
        opposite of the Church in Acts. We have become a
        church that seeks material gain for itself rather than to
        share with the poor, the outcast, or the outsiders.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even though following Jesus is a lost art; even
        though putting his words into practice may get you into
        trouble; even though others may criticize you and
        persecute you for attempting such a thing, I encourage
        you to follow Jesus today, and every day.
      </p>

      <h2> What was Jesus like? </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Compassionate</li>
        <li>Loving</li>
        <li>Caring</li>
        <li>Concerned for the poor, the sick, the outcast</li>
        <li>An advocate for peace</li>
        <li>Radically inclusive</li>
        <li>Interested in the lives of others</li>
        <li>Introduced a spiritual solution to our problems</li>
        <li>Comfortable around sinners</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What is the Christian Church like today?</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Intolerant of those who are not like us</li>
        <li>Uncomfortable around sinners</li>
        <li>Concerned for our own personal success</li>
        <li>Not so concerned with the poor, or the outcast</li>
        <li>Focused on political solutions to our problems</li>
        <li>Defined more by what we hate or dislike</li>
        <li>Largely supportive of war against our enemies</li>
      </ul>


      <h2> YOU ARE THE TEMPLE OF GOD</h2>

      <p>
        If we are God's new temple what does that mean?
        It means we are now the Holy Place. Our bodies - we are
        now the place where God's Spirit dwells. We carry
        around with us the immediate presence of God where
        those who are hungry to meet with Him can come and
        connect with Him.
      </p>



      <h2>YOU ARE THE ROYAL PRIESTHOOD</h2>

      <p>
        If you and I are the new priesthood it means that
        we are the ones who perform the daily sacrifice. We are
        the ones who are worthy to enter the "Holy of Holies" and
        approach God. We can hear God's voice. We have the
        honor of conveying the message of God to those who are
        outside the Temple. We now play an active role in the
        spiritual health and education of God's people.

        
      </p>
      <h2>YOU ARE THE DAILY SACRIFICE</h2>

      <p>
        If we are the daily, living sacrifice it means each of
        us have special access to God. Because of His ultimate
        sacrifice on the cross, our daily sacrifice bears witness to
        our desire to follow Jesus, surrender our lives to Him,
        and worship God with our entire being.
      </p>
      
      
      <h2>UNDERSTANDING WHO YOU ARE</h2>
      
      <p>
        You and I are this same Church. We are the
        people of God. We are part of something more unique
        and fabulous than any of us could have ever imagined.
        Who are you in Christ? You are a new creation.
        You are the Temple of God. You are the Priests of God.
        You are the daily, living sacrifice to God.
        We are a people unlike any the world has ever
        seen or imagined before. We are the Church.
      </p>
