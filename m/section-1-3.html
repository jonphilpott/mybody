    <h1>Old Testament Temple Worship</h1>

<p>
Now that we’ve seen God’s promise concerning
His plan to send a Messiah who would build a new
temple, let’s take a moment to explore key elements of
Jewish Temple worship. By understanding the basic
elements of the Old Testament form of worship, we can
better understand how the New Testament fulfillment of
these prophecies stand in contrast to what has gone
before.</p>


<p>
The basic elements of the Old Testament form of
worship include the temple, the priesthood, and the daily
sacrifice.</p>

<p>
Each of these elements is crucial to the Old
Testament model for worship. By examining these we
can get a better context for how the promised Messiah
would fulfill each of them, and establish a new, and more
complete, paradigm for worship.</p>

<p>
First, let’s look at the temple of God. The temple of
God is the Holy Place. It's where the Spirit of the Living
God dwells. Usually, in the Old Testament, God’s
presence is connected to the ark of the covenant, as we
have already seen. The temple is where those who are
hungry to meet with God go to connect with Him.</p>

<p class="bible">
"I was glad when they said to me, 'Let us go into
the house of the Lord.'" (Psalm 122:1)</p>

<p>
The temple in its most simplistic form is simply the
place where the presence of God dwells. Throughout the
Old Testament we are given several types of temple
forms. The first is the Garden of Eden. From the very
beginning God reveals to us His original intention – to
make his dwelling place with mankind. The Garden of
Eden is a type of temple because God is seen walking
with Adam and Eve in the cool of the day. He visits with
them and speaks to them in an intimate manner.</p>

<p>
Another type of temple in the Old Testament is the
mountain. Abraham’s testing of his faith takes place upon
Mount Moriah. Noah offers sacrifices to God on Mount
Ararat. God first speaks to Moses on Mount Horeb,
<span class="quote">“...the mountain of God”</span> (Exodus 3:1) and later, God also
speaks to Moses at Mount Sinai and gives the people the
ten commandments. At this time, the early forms of the
tabernacle, and later the temple itself, are revealed. God
appears in the form of a cloud at the top of the mountain.
Only Moses is allowed to ascend the mountain and meet
with God. The people are told not to touch the mountain
itself or they will die, much like the later command not to
touch the ark of the covenant. (See Exodus 19).</p>


<p>
The tabernacle, which literally means, “dwelling
place” was another early form of temple. It was
constructed according to God’s specific instructions (See
Exodus 36) and was built to house the ark of the
covenant. The tabernacle was an impermanent, easily
portable construction which moved with the Jewish
people as they wandered in the desert before entering
the promised land.</p>


<p>
Finally the temple built by Solomon (1 Kings 6) is
also a type of temple which points us to the ultimate, final
temple which the Messiah will build for God.</p>


<p>
The second element of Old Testament temple
worship is the sacrifice. This blood sacrifice of an animal
upon the altar in the temple was for the covering of sins
against God and against others. (See Numbers, chapter 15).</p>

<p>
Typically, a lamb without blemish would be
brought into the temple and offered upon the altar as an
atonement offering to God for sins. Once offered, the
sacrifice provided a return to fellowship with God and
access to the temple, and God’s presence.</p>


<p>
The final element in the Old Testament model of
worship is the priesthood. According to the scriptures, the
priests were set apart to God. Only a priest was allowed
to serve in God’s temple and perform the necessary
sacrifices. They are also the only ones who, through a
process of purification, were deemed worthy to enter the
"Holy of Holies" – where the ark of the covenant rested
behind a thick veil – and approach God’s presence.</p>


<p>
Priests are the ones who hear God's voice and
communicate God’s message to those who are outside
the Temple. The priests are primarily concerned with the
spiritual health and education of God’s people. To be a
priest was both a great honor, and a serious
responsibility.</p>


<p>
The Old Testament model of worship utilized
these three key elements; the temple, the sacrifice, and
the priesthood. However, as we have already seen,
God’s promise concerning the Messiah was that He
would build a new temple, one where the ark of the
covenant was not central. As radical as this seems, the
implication is that God’s presence would no longer
remain in a single geographical location, yet His Spirit
would fill the new temple. Therefore, the new temple
which was to be built by the Messiah would not be
located in a single geographic location.</p>


<p>
The implication would seem to be that for the
Messiah to accomplish his calling, he would have to bring
an end to the practices of the Old Covenant, and we
know that the only way to bring these practices to an end
would be to fulfill them.</p>

<p class="bible">
“But the ministry Jesus has received is as superior
to theirs as the covenant of which he is mediator is
superior to the old one, and it is founded on better
promises. For if there had been nothing wrong
with that first covenant, no place would have been
sought for another.” (Hebrews 8:6-7)</p>


<p>
Under the New Covenant, these forms are fulfilled,
or fully realized, and they cease to become necessary.
They are shadows which point to what has already come.
Once these shadows are fulfilled they no longer
serve any further purpose. Instead, the focus must shift
to the promise fulfilled, and to the one who has fulfilled
the promise.
