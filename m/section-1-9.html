    <h1>What the Church is Not</h1>
<p>

As we’ve seen, the New Testament uses several
words and metaphors to express the character, function,
and personality of the Church. Namely, the Church is a
Body, a Bride, a Temple, and a Family.
</p>


<p>
Now that we’ve spent time exploring what the
Church is, let’s take a hard look at what the Church isn’t.
</p>


<p>
The New Testament doesn’t ever refer to the
Church as an organization, as if it were a corporation or
an industry. Instead, the Church is referred to as an
organism. Therefore, according to the Apostles, and to
Jesus, the Church that God designed is not intended to
be thought of, or to be treated, like a business.
</p>


<p>
The Church that God always wanted is a family.
This means that pastors are not synonymous with CEOs.
It also means that the people in the Church are not to be
thought of, or treated, as employees, commodities, tithing
units, or assets. Instead, they are our brothers and
sisters in Christ and should be treated as such – with
love and respect.
</p>


<p>
This is about more than mere semantics. What
you believe about something, how you talk about it, how
you think of it, actually affects your behavior towards it or
concerning it. So, I have found that, if you think of the
Church as a business you will begin to expect certain
things from it that you wouldn’t expect from a family, and
vice versa.
</p>


<p>
For example, no one expects the family to grow in
size each quarter or post an annual profit. Families don’t
work that way, but corporations do. A father would not
treat his daughter like an employee. Nor would he base
his relationship on how much revenue she contributed to
the family. Corporations may act that way, but families do
not.
</p>


<p>
For a long time now, especially in the West, the
Church has turned her gaze to the world of big business.
She has based Her identity on a corporation rather than
the organic, family-based, relational design laid out for us
in Scripture.
</p>


<p>
Perhaps looking at some definitions will help us to
see the difference between an organism and an
organization.
</p>


<p class="bible">
<span>ORGANIZATION</span> – (Noun) 1- The act of
organizing a business or business-related activity;
"he was brought in to supervise the organization of
a new department". 2- The activity or result of
distributing or disposing persons or things properly
or methodically.
3- An ordered manner; orderliness by virtue of
being methodical and well organized.
</p>



<p class="bible">
<span>ORGANISM</span> – (Noun) 1- Any biological entity
capable of replication or of transferring genetic
material. 2- Any living entity that has (or can
develop) the ability to act or function
independently. 3- A system considered analogous
in structure or function to a living body.
</p>


<p>
God’s Word makes it clear to us that the Church is
an organism, a living Body made up of living parts which
function best when they are interconnected. God’s design
for His Church is relational.
</p>

<p>
“The body is a unit, though it is made up of many
parts; and though all its parts are many, they form
one body. So it is with Christ.” (1 Corinthians
12:12)
</p>


<p>
A family is a social unit made up of people who
share a common ancestor and engage in shared
activities and beliefs. The family is grounded in love and
it takes strength from the quality of the relationships
developed over time.
</p>


<p>
Healthy families love each other in spite of
difficulty, or hurt feelings. Families forgive and share.
Families pull together in a conflict. Families support one
another and encourage one another. But when a family is
run like a business it is impossible to maintain any of
these foundational values of love, loyalty, sharing,
forgiveness and protection.
</p>


<p>
A business is grounded in a completely different
set of values. A business is a collection of talented
people recruited to advance the interests of the company,
build recurring revenue streams and add value to the
business.
</p>


<p>
Whenever an employee becomes unproductive he
is eliminated. Whenever a more talented employee is
recruited, others are down-sized or let go. A business is
ultimately about making money and growing larger. A
business is mostly concerned with gaining market share
and outperforming the competition.
</p>


<p>
So, if we treat the House of God like a business
we will suddenly find ourselves engaging in activities that
serve to grow the business and eliminate the competition.
Ideas such as love and family and service and
community may become phrases used as metaphors to
describe the activities of our business. They will not be
expressed or embodied, in any real way, by those within
our organization.
</p>

<p>
A business is concerned with growth, not with how
happy, or healthy the employees may be. A business is
concerned with numbers, finances and outward signs of
success, it is not concerned with forgiveness, community
or love.
</p>


<p class="bible">
<span>BUSINESS</span> – (Noun) 1- A commercial or industrial
enterprise and the people who constitute it. 2-
The activity of providing goods and services
involving financial and commercial and industrial
aspects. 3- The principal activity in your life that
you do to earn money;
</p>


<p class="bible">
<span>FAMILY</span> – (Noun) 1- A social unit living together.
2- Primary social group; parents and children. 3-
People descended from a common ancestor. 4-
An association of people who share common
beliefs or activities. 5- A person having kinship
with another or others.
</p>


<p>
The people who make up a family are called
brothers and sisters. They are treated with love and
respect. They are all valued for who they are as people,
not for what they can do to improve the bottom line.
</p>


<p>
The people who make up a business are called
employees. They are treated as assets which the
company may exploit for financial gain. Employees are
regarded as individual components which contribute to
the overall success of the business. They are valued for
what they can add to the company, not for who they are
as people.
</p>


<p class="bible">
<span>EMPLOYEES</span> – (Noun) 1- A worker who is hired
to perform a job. 2- The employee contributes
labor to an enterprise. Employees perform the
discrete activity of economic production. An
employee may contribute to the evolution of the
enterprise, but usually has little control over the
productive infrastructure, such as intellectual
property and business contacts. Employees
usually are the labor in the three factors of
production, the others being land and capital.
</p>


<p class="bible">
<span>BROTHER</span> – (Noun) 1- A male with the same
parents as someone else. 2- A male person who
is a fellow member of a fraternity or religion or
other group). 3- Used as a term of address for
those male persons engaged in the same
movement.
</p>

<p class="bible">
<span>SISTER</span> – (Noun) 1- A female person who has the
same parents as another person. 2- A female
person who is a fellow member of a sorority or
religion or other group.
</p>


<p>
The Church, as Jesus designed it, is relational and
organic. According to the New Testament, God’s plan
was for His people to operate like a family, where He is
our Father. He created a church that operates like an
organism where He is our head, not like a business
where we set up certain people as CEO’s and treat
people as employees.
</p>


<p>
Clearly, the New Testament reveals that the
Church is a family, an organism and a Bride. It is never
referred to as a business venture.
</p>


<p>
As we’ve seen over and over again, the mission of
the Messiah was to build a suitable temple for God to
dwell in. Jesus alone is the one who is qualified to build
the temple of God, and we are that temple. We are a
spiritual house of living stones “not made with human
hands” but by the nail-scarred hands of God’s only son.
</p>


<p>
Put another way, the only true temple of God is
the one that is being built by Jesus, not one built by any
man, pastor, teacher or leader.
