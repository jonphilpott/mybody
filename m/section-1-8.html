    <h1>What the Church Is</h1>

<p>
In our next chapter I want to talk about what the
Church is not. But first it makes sense to spend time
exploring what the Church really is according to the New
Testament scriptures.
</p>


<p>
In the writings of Paul we see the Church defined
as an organism, or a body, where Christ is the only Head.
</p>


<p class="bible">
“And God placed all things under his feet and
appointed him to be head over everything for <b>the
church, which is his body,</b> the fullness of him
who fills everything in every way.” (Eph 1:22-23)
</p>


<p class="bible">
“For a husband is the head of his wife as Christ is
the head of the church. He is the Savior of <b>his
body, the church.”</b> (Eph 5:23)
</p>


<p class="bible">
“Christ is the head of <b>the church, which is his
body.”</b> (Colossians 1:18)
</p>


<p>
The New Testament also speaks of the Church as
being part of the Family of God where God is our Father
and Jesus is both our brother and our Lord.

</p>


<p class="bible">
“For those who are led by the Spirit of God <b>are the
children of God.</b>” (Romans 8:14)
</p>


<p class="bible">
“So in Christ Jesus <b>you are all children of God</b>
through faith.” (Galatians 3:26)
</p>


<p class="bible">
“See what great love the Father has lavished on
us, that we should be called <b>children of God!
And that is what we are!”</b> (1 John 3:1)
</p>


<p>
The New Testament also refers to the Church as a
Bride with Christ as our Bridegroom.
</p>


<p class="bible">
“Let us rejoice and be glad and give him glory! For
the wedding of the Lamb has come, and <b>his bride
has made herself ready.</b>” (Revelation 19:7)
</p>


<p class="bible">
“’For this reason a man will leave his father and
mother and be united to his wife, and the two will
become one flesh.’ This is a profound mystery—
but <b>I am talking about Christ and the church.</b>”
(Eph 5:31-32)
</p>


<p>
As we have already seen many times already, the
New Testament also affirms that the Church is a spiritual
house and a temple “not made with human hands” with
Christ as our chief cornerstone. (See Ephesians 2:21, 1
Peter 2:5, Hebrews 3:6)
</p>


<p>
We have also explored how the New Testament
reveals that the Church is a priesthood of believers who
are capable of hearing God’s voice and being taught by
the Holy Spirit. (See 1 Peter 2:5, Revelation 5:10, John
10:11-14)
</p>


<p>
Each of these pictures of the Church in the New
Testament reveals to us the nature of our identity in
Christ. We are invited to take part in an intimate
relationship with Christ Jesus Himself. We are His Body.
We are His Bride. We are His adopted children. We are
interconnected stones being built into a temple in which
He lives by His Spirit. We are His priests and His
ambassadors. He is our Bridegroom, our Head, our
brother and He is our High Priest.
</p>


<p>
Now that we know what the Church is, let us take
a moment to look closely, and honestly, at what the
Church is not.
