      <h1>Exploitation or Empowerment</h1>
      
      <p>
        Just imagine for a moment that you could be part
        of a church where the one thing they were extremely
        good at was to help everyone discover what their calling
        and gifting was. Then imagine that the one thing they
        always did next was to set you free and encourage you to
        follow that dream and live out that God-given calling.
        Wouldn’t that be amazing?
      </p>


      <p>
        Wouldn't it be incredible to be part of a church that
        was passionate about helping others realize their hopes
        and live out their dreams? Can you just imagine how
        others would speak of a church like that to their friends?
        "Do you know what these people did for me? They loved
        me, they supported me, they encouraged me, they gave
        me confidence, they cheered me on and they put their
        resources towards making my life-long purpose a reality."
      </p>


      <p>
        Wouldn't you want to know how to get to a church
        like that? Wouldn't you be excited to get in line and have
        your turn at being empowered and loved and supported
        and set free to live out the calling and utilize the talents
        God gave to you?
      </p>


      <p>
        I just have to wonder, why isn't every Christian
        Church on the face of the planet like this?
      </p>


      <p>
        Wolfgang Simson, in his book Houses That
        Change the World, put together a fascinating list to help
        us see the difference between Church as God intended it
        and Church as we so often experience it:
      </p>


      <p>
        Give people something to do, or give people
        something to attend. Believe in people, or make
        people believe in you. Delegate authority, or
        require submission to your authority. Further God's
        plan for their life, or make them part of your plans.
        Invest in them, or use them. Love them and show
        it, or love the task more than the people. Give
        them what you have, or take what they have.
        Provide resources for growth, or harvest their
        resources for your own use. Discuss with them, or
        preach at them. Spend time freely with them, or
        require appointments that suit your schedule. Give
        them the keys now, or hold back until you retire.
        Serve them, or get them to serve you. Praise
        them, or accept their praise graciously. Transfer
        masterhood to them, or demonstrate your master-
        hood to them. <a class="fn" href="footnotes.html#section-1-15-13">13</a>

      <h2>APPLE TREES, NOT JUST APPLES</h2>

      <p>
        Someone once pointed out to me that the goal of
        an apple tree is not to produce more apples. It's to
        produce more apple trees. This is the organic purpose
        found in nature, and it's the organic purpose of the Body
        of Christ as well.
      </p>


      <p>
        When an apple tree produces apples that's
        important. You can't really be an apple tree and not
        produce apples, of course. But if everything ended there
        the apple tree would not have achieved the purpose for
        which God designed it. The apple tree must produce
        more apple trees in order to realize its full potential.
        Otherwise, when that tree dies, so does the potential for
        creating more apples.
      </p>


      <p>
        In the context of the Christian church I see too
        many pastors and church leaders who are terrified of
        taking their brightest and most talented people and
        releasing them into the world. They feel that losing those
        gifted, intelligent, talented individuals will somehow make
        their church poorer and weaker. So they expend a whole
        lot of energy trying to keep those people busy and
        connected and plugged in to what they are doing instead
        of encouraging them to discover their gifting and calling
        and releasing them to go and to do whatever it is that
        God has created them for.
      </p>


      <p>
        A church that practiced encouraging growth like
        this would be responsible for spawning ministries and
        providing good fruit for the community on an exponential
        level. It would also be living out the command of
        Scripture to seek the good of others around us rather
        than selfishly seeking our own good (see Philippians 2:3).
      </p>


      <p>
        Usually the only way someone with talent and
        vision ever leaves one church to start another is when
        they leave under protest and start something all by
        themselves. Why? Because most pastors will tell you that
        they are not ready to start planting a church until they
        reach 500 members. The problem with that is when you
        realize that the average church in America is only about
        250 to 300 people. Most never reach the 500 mark, and
        honestly when they do reach that milestone few of those
        churches ever actually plant another church because
        they have not planned to do so.
      </p>


      <h2>JUST IMAGINE</h2>

      <p>
        Imagine what it would be like if the Church really
        was a place where everyone was encouraged and
        empowered and released to live out the calling God has
        placed on them. I believe that any church that actually
        lived that out and practiced this sort of extravagant
        empowerment wouldn't be able to contain the people who
        flocked to their doorstep. They also wouldn't be able to
        survive the flood of people unless they were continually
        sending people out and giving away their brightest and
        best to fulfill the destiny God had placed on them.

      </p>


      <p>
        I can't help but feel that this was what Jesus had in
        mind all along. When he commanded us to love one
        another and share everything we had with others, Jesus
        was deputizing us to do the work he started. Jesus
        trained a handful of men to be salt and light in the world
        and then he cut them loose and set them free to live out
        the things he had taught them. He also commanded them
        to repeat that pattern over and over again. 
        <span class="quote">
          Go into the world and make disciples of all nations...teaching them to
          obey all that I have commanded you..."
        </span> 
        he said. And
        that's exactly what they did. Over and over again. They
        followed Jesus and they taught others how to follow
        Jesus so that they could go out and teach others how to
        follow Jesus too.
      </p>


      <h2>A SCHOOL THAT YOU NEVER GRADUATE FROM</h2>

      <p>
        A friend of mine once pointed out that traditional
        churches today are like schools full of people who will
        never graduate. Everyone has to sit through essentially
        the same lecture each week and there is no homework
        (so the pastor doesn't test who is putting things into
        practice or not), and worst of all no one ever graduates
        and becomes an instructor themselves.
      </p>


      <p>
        Here's a great solution: Teach people to become
        teachers. If you are in the habit of training others to
        become trainers of others (this is a very basic principle of
        discipleship), you will eventually end up with a church full
        of teachers and trainers who are training others to also
        be teachers and trainers.
      </p>


      <h2>RETURN TO THE PRIESTHOOD OF BELIEVERS</h2>

      <p>
        Most pastors and on-staff ministers can relate to
        the fact that only a handful of people do all the work and
        ministry in the Body while 80% to 90% sit back and do
        nothing. This creates frustration, burn-out and, honestly,
        a large group of underdeveloped disciples.
      </p>

      <p>
        What happened to the Priesthood of the Believer?
        What happened to opening the Word of God and trusting
        the Holy Spirit to lead you into all truth?
      </p>


      <p class="bible">
        “But you are not like that, for you are a chosen
        people. You are royal priests, a holy nation, God’s
        very own possession. As a result, you can show
        others the goodness of God, for he called you out
        of the darkness into his wonderful light.” (1 Peter
        2:9)
      </p>


      <p>
        The liberty offered to us in Christ Jesus was meant
        to empower every believer to become a committed and
        devoted disciple who goes and creates other committed
        and devoted disciples. The early church was not full of
        seminary trained Bible teachers. Most of those who lead
        the weekly gatherings in their homes were average,
        ordinary people like you and me. They were led by the
        Holy Spirit as they prayed, studied the Scriptures and
        met together with other followers of Jesus each week.
      </p>


      <p>
        In my experience within the house church I can
        testify to the truth of the Scriptures where God promises
        that He will build His church. He doesn’t need our help.
        He is also true to His word and promise that the Holy
        Spirit will lead us into all Truth (John 16:13; 1 Cor 12)
      </p>


      <h2>THE POWER OF LETTING GO</h2>
      <p>
        We have a tendency in our traditional churches to
        centralize certain people as leaders and, in turn, we
        disqualify everyone else from participating. I believe that
        this is not the way God intended things to be. We were
        not saved and filled with the Holy Spirit to simply remain
        spectators as a select few act out their calling and live
        out their purpose.
      </p>


      <p>
        Each of us in the Body of Christ has a specific
        calling and gift. If we are not set free to use it as God
        intended not only will we suffer as individuals, we will
        suffer as a Body, and the nation will suffer due to our
        unrealized potential.
      </p>


      <p>
        Let me encourage you to discover your calling as
        a valued member of God’s Family. Once you’ve heard
        God’s voice and you’ve understood the purpose God has
        for you as an agent of change within this culture, let me
        be the first to urge you to step outside the nest and
        spread your wings.-
      </p>


      <p>
        If you feel called to start a Bible Study in your
        home, do it. If you feel called to go out into the streets
        and reach out to the homeless, or to the prostitute, go for
        it. If you have a passion to start a new kind of church that
        facilitates community and reaches a new generation,
        make it so.
      </p>


      <p>
        Don’t allow anyone to hold you back. The
        Kingdom is wide open. Take that first leap...and soar!
