      "Properly speaking, New Testament Christianity knows
      nothing of the word ‘sacrament,’ which belongs essentially to the
      heathen world of the Graeco-Roman empire and which unfortunately
      some of the Reformers unthinkingly took over from ekklesiastical
      tradition. For this word, and still more the overtones which it conveys,
      is the starting point for those disastrous developments which began
      soon to transform the community of Jesus into the Church which is
      first and foremost a sacramental Church"
