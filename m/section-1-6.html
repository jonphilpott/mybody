      <h1>Every Believer a Priest of God</h1>

      “It was never in the mind of God that a privileged
      priesthood of sinful, imperfect men would attempt,
      following the death and triumphant resurrection of
      our Lord Jesus Christ, to repair the veil and
      continue their office of mediation between God
      and man. The letter to the Hebrews makes that
      fact very plain. When Jesus rose from the dead,
      the Levitical priesthood, which had served Israel
      under the Old Covenant, became redundant.”
      – A. W.Tozer <a class="fn" href="footnotes.html#section-1-6-3">3</a>


      <p>
        According to the New Testament, it was never
        God’s plan to have His New Covenant Church operate
        like a Levitical priesthood. Jesus commanded His
        disciples not to emulate the top-down organizational
        structures of either the Jewish religion (Matt 23:8-12), or
        of the Pagan authorities (Mark 10:42-45). Instead, He
        urged them to treat one another as brothers and as
        equals.
      </p>


      <p>
        Paul, in 1 Corinthians, chapter 12, outlines God’s
        plan for the Church to operate as a Body. In this New
        Testament model, Jesus is the only Head and the people
        within the Church are empowered – each and every one
        of them – by the Holy Spirit to minister to one another.

      </p>


      <p class="bible">
        “Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is
        given for the common good.” (1 Corinthians 12:7)
      </p>


      <p>
        Notice how each of these various gifts are
        distributed to the Body, by the Holy Spirit for a single
        purpose: “for the common good.” God does this so that
        everyone in the Body is necessary and so that everyone
        contributes and shares the burden of ministry.
      </p>


      <p class="bible">
        “All these are the work of one and the same Spirit,
        and he gives them to each one, just as he
        determines.” (1 Corinthians 12:11)
      </p>


      <p>
        Notice that Paul doesn’t say, “..he gives them to
        ONE PERSON” but that these gifts are given to “each
        one” of the members within the Body.
      </p>


      <p class="bible">
        “The body is a unit, though it is made up of many
        parts; and though all its parts are many, they form
        one body. So it is with Christ.” (1 Corinthians
        12:12)
      </p>


      <p>
        Notice how the body is a reflection of Christ
        himself if we operate as a unit made up of many parts all
        working together under the headship of Christ. The
        implication is that if we do not function as God designed,
        we are not reflecting Christ to the world.
      </p>


      <p class="bible">
        “For we were all baptized by one Spirit into one
        body—whether Jews or Greeks, slave or free—
        and we were all given the one Spirit to drink.” (1
        Corinthians 12:13)
      </p>


      <p>
        Notice how throughout 1 Corinthians 12 the
        emphasis is not on one particular member but on the
        entire Body itself. This is especially significant when you
        consider that this church in Corinth was probably one of
        the most troubled and morally challenged churches in
        early Christian history. Even so, Paul never abandons the
        shared body ministry in order to correct these errors. He
        never commands their elders to take control and whip
        people into shape. He never addresses the senior pastor
        at all in this letter, or any other letter. Why? Because
        there wasn’t one.
      </p>


      <p>
        The overwhelming evidence throughout the New
        Testament is that every baptized believer in Christ was
        automatically ordained by the Holy Spirit into the ministry
        of Jesus. There was no separation between clergy and
        laity.
      </p>


      <p>
        Were there some within the Body who were gifted
        to teach and to encourage and to lead? Yes, of course.
        But the entire life of the Church did not revolve around
        these few. Instead, every single believer was empowered
        to contribute and to speak and to use their gifting as the
        Holy Spirit directed.
      </p>


      <p>
        According to the New Testament, when the church
        actually functions as a real Body, and when Jesus is
        really the Shepherd, the entire Body will be healthy and
        operate as God intended all along.
      </p>


      <p>
        It makes me wonder how can we continually refer
        to ourselves as “The Body of Christ” if we do not actually
        engage in the organic form of shared life as described in
        1 Corinthians 12.

      </p>

      <p class="bible">
        “Any system which operates to forbid or render
        impossible the functioning of every priest
        according to ability is subversive of God's whole
        system.” – W. Carl Ketcherside <a class="fn" href="footnotes.html#section-1-6-4">4</a>
      </p>


      <p>
        Chances are that, unless you are an ordained
        pastor, you don't consider yourself as being qualified to
        baptize a new believer, lead others in the Lord's Supper,
        or pray for someone dying of cancer in the hospital. If so,
        you are not alone. Most people who attend Christian
        churches today would not feel it was their place to
        baptize a new believer or perform any of the functions
        normally reserved for the clergy.
      </p>


      <p>
        The sad thing is, your Bible suggests otherwise. In
        fact, Paul the Apostle says on several occasions that
        every member of the Body is competent to lead, to
        instruct, to exhort and to share.
      </p>


      <p>
        For example, in Romans 15:14 Paul says, <span class="quote">I
          myself am convinced, my brethren, that you yourselves
          are full of goodness, complete in knowledge and
          competent to instruct one another.”</span> In 1 Corinthians
        14:31 Paul says, <span class="quote">"For you can all prophesy in turn so that
          everyone may be instructed and encouraged".</span>
      </p>


      <p>
        This last verse specifies a shared prophetic gifting
        within the Body, but this shared dynamic is not limited to
        that specific gifting, especially when compared to what
        Paul has previously communicated in chapter 12 of this
        same epistle.
      </p>


      <p>
        One of the most illuminating verses of scripture in
        the New Testament which gives us a clear picture of
        what the original New Testament expression of Church
        looked like is found in 1 Corinthians 14:26, which says:
      </p>


      <p class="bible">
        "What then shall we say, brethren? When you
        come together, everyone has a hymn, or a word of
        instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an
        interpretation. All of these must be done for the
        strengthening of the church."
      </p>


      <p>
        Here we see a gathering of Believers who all
        partake of Christ together, sharing their God-given gifts
        with one another in love for the common good.
        The fact is that Jesus gave birth to a Church that
        was radically different from anything that had ever been
        known before, or since. It was a Church where every
        believer was a priest of God and every member was a
        Temple of His Holy Spirit. The only daily sacrifice was
        performed by average, everyday people who were filled
        by the Spirit of the Living God and empowered to live
        radical lives of love in demonstration of the Gospel
        message.
      </p>



      <p>
        The doctrine of the Priesthood of the Believer is nearly
        unheard of in today's Churches, and rarely preached on. Mainly,
        I would suspect, because for any traditional church to follow
        through with the implications of this doctrine, many pastors
        would soon find themselves out of a job. Nevertheless, the New
        Testament reveals an early Church where everyone participated
        and shared their spiritual gifts openly with the rest of the Body.
        In 1 Corinthians 12:4, Paul says:
      </p>


      <p>
        "There are different kinds of gifts, but the same
        Spirit. There are different kinds of service, but the
        same Lord. There are different kinds of working,
        but the same God works all of them in all people."
      </p>


      <p>
        As we’ve already pointed out, Paul does not say, "...but
        the same God works all of them in <b>one man.</b>" If he did then we
        might have a Biblical basis for the all-in-one religious
        professionals that we currently employ today. Instead, as
        numerous Biblical Scholars (such as F.F. Bruce, Gordon Fee,
        and Robert Banks), have clearly remarked, the early Church
        knew nothing of the clergy class of leader we see today.
      </p>


      <p>
        Another Biblical Scholar, Howard Snyder, has also said:
      </p>


      <p class="bible">
        “The clergy-laity dichotomy is a direct carry-over
        from pre-Reformation Roman Catholicism and a
        throwback to the Old Testament priesthood. It is
        one of the principal obstacles to the church
        effectively being God’s agent of the kingdom today
        because it creates a false idea that only 'holy
        men,' namely, ordained ministers, are really
        qualified and responsible for leadership and
        significant ministry. In the New Testament there
        are functional distinctions between various kinds
        of ministries but no hierarchical division between
        clergy and laity. The New Testament teaches us
        that the church is a community in which all are
        gifted and all have ministry.” <a class="fn" href="footnotes.html#section-1-6-5">5</a>
      </p>



      <p>
        Biblical Scholar William Bausch, himself a Roman
        Catholic, also freely admits that the New Testament
        Church knew nothing of the One-Man-Pastorate that we
        employ in today's modern Christianity:
      </p>


      <p class="bible">
        “Our survey has shown us that no cultic priesthood
        is to be found in the New Testament. Yet we
        wound up importing Old Testament, Levitical
        forms and imposing them on Christian ministry . . .
        Nevertheless in practice there is no denying that
        there has historically been a gathering into one
        person and his office what were formerly the gifts
        of many . . .[This practice] goes astray, of course,
        when it translates to mean that only ordination
        gives competence, authority, and the right of
        professional governance. It goes further astray
        when eventually all jurisdictional and
        administrative powers in the church come to be
        seen as an extension of the sacramental powers
        conferred at ordination. In short, there is a
        movement here away from the more pristine
        collaborative and mutual ministries of the New
        Testament." <a class="fn" href="footnotes.html#section-1-6-6">6</a>
      </p>


      <p>
        Whenever someone suggests that it is unbiblical
        for the average Christian to teach, preach, baptize, or
        prophesy on a regular basis they are dead wrong. While
        the New Testament teaches us that not all Christians are
        specifically gifted as teachers, prophets, or apostles, (see
        1 Corinthians 12:29) it also teaches that every Christian
        is a minister, a functioning priest, and is capable of
        instructing, prophesying, and exhorting in the church.
      </p>
      <p>
        The truth is that if you are a spirit-filled child of
        God then the Holy Spirit living within you has already
        licensed, ordained and empowered you to begin your
        ministry as a Priest of God in the Name of Jesus Christ,
        and the function of the Body is to encourage and equip
        you to walk out that Divine calling every day of your life.
        It doesn’t take much digging around to uncover a host of
        Biblical Scholars who freely admit that our modern divide
        between Clergy and Laity is not a New Testament
        concept.
      </p>


      <p>
        As Herbert Haag said:
      </p>

      <p class="bible">
        "In the Catholic Church there are two classes,
        clergy and laity...This structure does not
        correspond to what Jesus did and taught.
        Consequently it has not had a good effect in the
        history of the Church ...Among his disciples Jesus
        did not want any distinction of class or rank...In
        contradiction to this instruction of Jesus, a
        ‘hierarchy,’ a ‘sacred authority,’ was nevertheless
        formed in the third century.” <a class="fn" href="footnotes.html#section-1-6-7">7</a>
      </p>


      <p>
        Jesus was quite clear when he pulled his Disciples
        aside (many of whom would go on to become the
        Apostles who would shape the New Testament Church)
        and said to them:
      </p>


      <p class="bible">
        "(The Pharisees) do all their deeds to be seen by
        others...But you are not to be called rabbi, for you
        have one teacher, and you are all brothers." (Matt.
        23:5)
      </p>


      <p>
        What did Jesus mean by this? Did He seriously
        intend to communicate that He was the only head of His
        Church? Could He really mean that they were not to set
        up a hierarchical system of Church government?
      </p>



      <p>
        Let's ask ourselves the following questions:
      </p>


      <p>
        Where in the Scriptures can we find anyone other
        than Christ who is called the head of the Church?
      </p>


      <p>
        The truth is, Jesus never relinquished control over
        His Disciples or His Church, to any human being. But,
        you might ask, didn't Jesus assign anyone to lead the
        Church in His absence? Yes, He did:
      </p>


      <p class="bible">
        "But I tell you the truth: It is for your good that I am
        going away. Unless I go away, the Counselor will
        not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to
        you...But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he
        will guide you into all truth. He will not speak on
        his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he
        will tell you what is yet to come. He will bring glory
        to me by taking from what is mine and making it
        known to you." (John 14:7; 13-15)
      </p>


      <p>
        Here we see that Jesus did leave someone in
        charge in His absence – the Holy Spirit. Therefore, Jesus
        continues to lead His Church today, as His people (the
        Body) respond to His leadership and submit to Him and
        to the Holy Spirit.
      </p>


      <p>
        The practical implications of this teaching suggest
        that whenever believers in Christ gather together in His
        name, the author of the Scriptures is in our midst. The
        central character of the Bible lives within us and He is
        capable of making His will known to us. I declare to you,
        with complete confidence, that if you read the Word of
        God and ask the Lord to reveal Himself to you and to
        teach you, He will do it! Here’s how I know:
      </p>


      <p class="bible">
        “If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God,
        who gives generously to all without finding fault,
        and it will be given to him.” (James 1:5)
      </p>


      <p class="bible">
        “As for you, the anointing you received from him
        remains in you, and you do not need anyone to
        teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about
        all things and as that anointing is real, not
        counterfeit--just as it has taught you, remain in
        him.” (1 John 2:27)
      </p>


      <p class="bible">
        “For where two or three come together in my
        name, there am I with them." – Jesus (Matt 18:20)
      </p>


      <p>
        So, even if the people who have the gift of
        teaching are not present for one of our gatherings, it is
        still possible for everyone else in the room to read the
        Scriptures, and pray, and ask God for wisdom and
        insight. If they do this they should expect to receive
        revelation from God Himself through the Holy Spirit.
      </p>


      <p>
        In this way, the Church is never without a teacher.
        She has been filled with the Spirit of God, and the head
        of the Church is in her midst. Jesus has promised that He
        is the Good Shepherd and that His sheep can hear His
        voice. (see John 10:14-16)
      </p>


      <p>
        Is it only the leader who can hear the voice of the
        Shepherd? Or can everyone hear the voice of their Lord?
        The New Testament strongly argues in favor of the latter.
      </p>


      <p>
        Again, this doesn't make everyone in the room a
        teacher, but everyone in the room does have access to
        hear The Teacher and share what they learn from Him.
      </p>


      <p>
        Therefore, it’s still possible for everyone in the
        Body to come together under the Headship of Christ and
        share the gifts they’ve received from the Holy Spirit and
        participate in the life of Jesus together.
      </p>


      <h2>WHAT ABOUT LEADERSHIP?</h2>

      <p>
        Some have suggested that this radical picture of
        "every-believer-a-priest" goes too far and leaves us with
        a leaderless Church founded on anarchy and chaos.
        However, nothing could be further from the truth.
      </p>


      <p>
        Every Church requires leadership and God has
        not left us without it. I believe the New Testament
        demonstrates a plurality of leadership within the Church
        because every believer is a priest of God. For example,
        whenever anyone in our house church is sharing he or
        she is leading us. It may be a seven year old girl, a
        twelve year old boy, a forty year old man, or anyone else
        in the room. This is not the end of leadership, it is sharing
        leadership among the members of the Body, with an
        understanding that Christ alone is our true leader.
      </p>


      <p>
        In a larger sense, Christ is still the leader of His
        Church, not any one person or persons. He might lead
        through us as we submit to Him and respond to His Holy
        Spirit, but it is still Christ who is leading us.
      </p>


      <p>
        So, what is at stake? Do models really matter?
        Can't God work through us no matter how we gather or
        who our leader is? Yes, of course God can, and does,
        work through any and all means to advance His Kingdom
        and communicate His Gospel. We are all unworthy
        vessels and in the end God's perfect will is accomplished
        no matter where or how we gather.
      </p>


      <p>
        But, I would simply ask, if you knew that God had
        something special in mind from the beginning, and if you
        could see Biblical evidence for a form of Church that
        empowered every believer to function and contribute to
        the health of the Body, wouldn't you at least want to give
        it a shot?
      </p>


      <p>
        If there was a way to enter into the kind of
        community we read about in the book of Acts, why
        wouldn't you want to entertain the possibility that it could
        be within our grasp? Why wouldn't you be willing to
        surrender anything it took to have a Church like that?
      </p>


      <p>
        Granted, models in themselves only provide the
        framework. We can see that even those original
        Christians who gathered in their homes and operated
        under the headship of Christ were anything but perfect.
        On the contrary, they were just as weak and prone to
        failure as the rest of us. What changes us is Christ, not
        any model of church or method of worship. However, the
        fact remains that God clearly communicates in the New
        Testament that the Church founded by Jesus and the
        form practiced by the early Christians was in fulfillment of
        His express purpose and desire to establish a temple not
        made with human hands, where Christ is the Head and
        where the people of God share equally in the ministry.
      </p>

      <p>

        Certainly those of us who have made the decision
        to gather together in an organic way and step into the
        priesthood of the believer are in the minority, for now. But
        according to Leadership Magazine, Christianity Today,
        Focus on the Family and Rev Magazine, approximately
        1,500 pastors a month leave the traditional pastorate in
        the United States alone, and a recent Gallop poll showed
        that 1 million adult Christians per year leave the
        institutional church in the U.S. – and that number is
        growing.

        I believe that God is up to something. I believe that
        many of the one million people who leave their pews this
        year are being lead by the Holy Spirit to enter into a form
        of Church which Jesus inspired from the beginning, and
        even now is calling some within His Body to experience
        today.

      <p>
        As author Reggie McNeal, an authority on church
        leadership, has said, <span class="quote">"A growing number of people are
          leaving the institutional church for a new reason. They
          are not leaving because they have lost their faith. They
          are leaving the church to preserve their faith."</span><a class="fn" href="footnotes.html#section-1-6-8">8</a>

      <h2>GOD’S CHURCH. GOD’S DESIGN</h2>

      <p>
        For far too long men have wrestled with God for
        control over His people. Jesus modeled a servant
        leadership style for His disciples, and today many of our
        leaders emphasize a CEO brand of leadership patterned
        after the world of big business.
      </p>


      <p>
        The Apostle Paul told us that we are the Temple of
        the Holy Spirit, yet many ministers today insist on
        collecting millions of dollars from their flock to build a
        temple where people can worship.
      </p>


      <p>
        The Apostle Peter told us that we are the living
        stones God is building up to become His Church, and
        instead we are convinced that building the Church
        involves filling the pews on Sunday morning.
      </p>


      <p>
        Jesus commanded us to make disciples, those
        who would follow His teachings and apply them to their
        everyday life. Instead we have become experts at
        entertaining the saints each week and occasionally
        converting a few to our denomination.
      </p>


      <p>
        I end this chapter with an eye-opening quote by
        the great philosopher, Soren Kierkegaard:
      </p>


      <p class="bible">
        “The matter is quite simple. The Bible is very easy
        to understand. But we Christians are a bunch of
        swindlers. We pretend to be unable to understand
        it because we know very well that the minute we
        understand it, we are obliged to act accordingly.
        Take any words in the New Testament and forget
        everything except pledging yourself to act
        accordingly. ‘My God,’ you will say, ‘if I do that my
        whole life will be ruined. How would I ever get on
        in the world’? Herein lies the real place of
        Christian scholarship. Christian scholarship is the
        Church’s prodigious invention to defend itself
        against the Bible, to ensure that we can continue
        to be good Christians without the Bible coming too
        close. Oh, priceless scholarship, what would we
        do without you? Dreadful it is to fall into the hands
        of the living God. Yes, it is even dreadful to be
        alone with the New Testament.” <a class="fn" href="footnotes.html#section-1-6-9">9</a>
      </p>


      <p>
        Let us be people who put the words of Jesus into
        practice every day of our lives, by the Grace of God.
