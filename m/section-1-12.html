    <h1>Who Will Build the House?</h1>

<p class="bible">
“Unless the LORD builds the house, its builders
labor in vain.” (Psalm 127:1)
</p>


<p>
Whenever I read about a local church raising
millions of dollars to build a house where they can
worship God it grieves my heart. Why? Because God
Himself has already promised to build His house, His
Temple. He does not need our help to do this.
</p>

<p class="bible">
“And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock
I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will
not overcome it.” (Matthew 16:18)
</p>


<p>
Why are we still building man-made temples to
God when we already have the Spirit of the Living God
living within each and every one of us who follow Jesus
Christ as Lord and Savior? God already commissioned a
new temple over two thousand years ago. It was also
very costly and was purchased at the expense of God’s
own Son. On the cross, Jesus destroyed the temple of
His Body and fulfilled God’s promise to pour out His Spirit
on all flesh. God Himself tore the veil in the old temple,
even as the foundation was being laid upon the
Cornerstone of the New Temple of God.
</p>


<p>
What’s sad to me is that people still believe that
they must come each week to a certain place in order to
worship and celebrate God. Yet God’s design was to
expand His worship to cover the earth, and to become a
daily, living act of praise and surrender and worship to
His amazing and Holy name. Not for one holy day but for
every single day of the week.
</p>


<p>
People do not need a building. They need to know
a God who loves them. They do not need an impersonal
club to join. They need to be embraced into the loving
Family of God. They do not hunger for giant screen
televisions and professional sound systems. They are
yearning for an intimate relationship with Jesus.
</p>


<p>
When Jesus had fulfilled the role of the High Priest
and offered himself as the final Lamb of God, and the veil
in the temple was ripped in half, from top to bottom, He
made a way for us, the people of God, to become the
new temple, not made with human hands, but spreading
out over the whole earth, and living as the new
priesthood of believers, to make known His Glory among
the nations.
</p>


<p>
We do not need a temple because we are the
temple. We do not need a priest, or a senior pastor,
because we are all priests of God, empowered and filled
by His Holy Spirit. We do not need an animal sacrifice to
be made, because He was our final blood sacrifice, and
we are now the living sacrifice, daily dying to ourselves
and carrying our cross to follow Him.
</p>

<p>

Let us not return to the rubble and rebuild the
man-made temple. Let us not take up needle and thread
and repair the veil that was torn. Let us not commission
special priests and clergy who will stand before God in
our place.
</p>


<p>
Our identity, as followers of Jesus, runs deeper
than brick and mortar. It transcends a building. It goes
beyond ceremony. Our identity as disciples of Christ is
defined by a relationship between a Loving God, and a
Living Temple made of people who love God, and love
others.
</p>


<p>
You are the temple God has always wanted. He
has already bought and paid for us. Let us focus our time
and energy on "being the Church," not attending one, or
building one out of stone.
</p>


<h2>SHIFTING MY PARADIGM</h2>

<p>
The year I was licensed and ordained as a pastor
they handed me a key to the church building. I was
barely 22 years old, newly married, with a heart full of
hope about my calling to pastor God's people.
On Sunday evenings I would unlock the old
building an hour early and wander through the dark
corridors behind the stage, through the choir room, up
through the narrow stairway to the baptistry, quietly
talking with God as I moved through the silence of an
empty church.
</p>


<p>
Those were sweet times for me. I remember
pouring my heart out to God during those moments,
dreaming of the future, wondering where my journey with
God would take me, how things would turn out down the
road.
</p>


<p>
Imagine my shock when someone suggested to
me that God didn't actually live in that place. He didn't
splash in the baptistry when no one was there. He didn't
hum His favorite hymns in the darkness waiting for us to
return on Sunday morning or Wednesday evening. He
wasn't confined to that place as if it were some Holy
container for His Glory.
</p>


<p>
That idea took me some time to process. I knew in
my heart it was true. God's word even supported the
concept that man could not build a house for him, nor did
he ever ask for us to construct a castle for his Spirit to
dwell. In fact, the only temple God has ever wanted was
you and me.
</p>


<p>
The more this idea permeated my mind, the more
revolutionary it became to me. I realized that I could have
that same intimate experience with God that I enjoyed in
the empty church building on Sunday evenings in my car,
or at work, or in the park, or anywhere I went. It was very
liberating and empowering for me.
</p>


<p>
Since we started our house church over several
years ago, I have had another revelation about the
House of God. As we've been hosting church in our living
room, our family actually lives in the very place where our
church gathers to fellowship and worship.
</p>


<p>
My own house is now the House of God. I eat in
this same house. My family wakes up every single day of
the week in this house of worship. We laugh here, we
argue here, we cry here, we play here, and we live each
day in the same house where the worship and the Bible
study and the singing take place every week.
</p>


<p>
It begins to change the way you think of your
house. It starts to affect the way you live. It changes the
way you interact with God.
</p>


<p>
God is not hidden away in a large building
somewhere. I do not visit Him each week and catch up
on lost time. He does not remain behind when my family
leaves to go out to lunch with friends, nor does He sleep
on the floor waiting for me to return for Sunday worship.
</p>


<p>
God has made His home within me. My house is
the place where we worship and fellowship each week,
but I carry around in my soul the very presence of the
living God. Even as I sit at my desk at work, I am on Holy
Ground. Even as I pump gas at the gas station, I am in
the presence of the King of the Universe. Even as I sit
here, typing this article on my computer, sipping my
coffee, listening to my favorite music, I am not far from
Church.
</p>


<p>
In fact, I am a member of the Church. God has
made His home in me and this is simply a foretaste of the
day when I move into His house and eat at His table and
we are forever, eternally, together.
</p>


<p>
What if your house was the House of God? Would
it change what you watch on television? Would it affect
the way you treat your spouse or your children?
Even more, what if the House of God were within
your own heart? What if the new ark of the covenant was
inside of you? Would it change the things you thought
about when no one was watching? This is what the
Gospel is all about, isn’t it? This is why the scriptures
declare:
</p>


<p class="bible">
“God has chosen to make known among the
Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which
is Christ in you, the hope of glory.” (Col.1:27)
</p>


<p>
Truth be told, you and I are the temple of the Holy
Spirit. We are the Body of Christ. We are His hands and
His feet. We are His ambassadors. Christ really does
make His home within us. Let us celebrate our identity as
the household of God and learn what it truly means to “be
the Church” rather than attend one
