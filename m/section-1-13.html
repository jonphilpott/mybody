      <h1>Out of Business</h1>
      <p>
        "The God who made the world and everything in it
        is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live
        in temples built by hands." (Acts 17:24)
      </p>


      <p>
        I believe it's time the Church went out of business.
        Close down the bank account, lay off the pastoral staff,
        cancel the utilities, sell the building, auction off the sound
        system and the digital projector and turn out the lights.
      </p>


      <p>
        I know that this is a radical concept, even a
        scandalous one to most. But it is my firm conviction that
        the Church needs to get out of the business of being in
        business because it was never intended by its founder to
        be run like a business in the first place.
      </p>


      <p>
        The Church as Jesus imagined it has always been
        a living organism, not an organization employing a team
        of spiritual experts. The Church that Jesus died to give
        birth to isn't a business; it's a family of equals who all love
        one another in a way the world can only dream of.
      </p>


      <p>
        If acting like a business prevents us from being the
        Family God intended, let us joyfully put ourselves out of
        business and learn what it means to be the Body of
        Christ in our community. If operating as an organization
        holds us back from spending time with the neighbors we
        are commanded to love, then let us resign our pastoral
        positions and refuse our stipends so that we can share
        the vibrant love of Jesus with the people living in
        darkness right next door to us.
      </p>


      <p>
        Instead of hiring accountants to handle our books,
        let us join our hands together and walk outside where
        Jesus always intended His Church to thrive – among the
        everyday people, the ordinary citizens, the sinners who
        would never feel at home in our temples.
      </p>


      <p>
        Instead of investing in state of the art sound
        systems, let us get down on our knees and wipe the dirt
        from the faces of the impoverished children who live in
        our very own cities, just a few miles from our own
        doorstep, and let us love them as Jesus would have
        loved them.
      </p>


      <p>
        Instead of raising millions of dollars to buy a larger
        building with giant flat-panel television screens in the
        rotunda, let us give of ourselves, our time, our talent, our
        energy, our passion and our very best in order to bring
        the Kingdom of God to a world that so desperately needs
        hope.
      </p>


      <p>
        I wonder along with Frederick Buechner, <span class="quote">“..if the
          best thing that could happen to many a church might not
          be to have its building burn down and to lose all of its
          money. Then all that the people would have left would be
          God and each other.”</span> <a class="fn" href="footnotes.html#section-1-13-11">11</a>
      </p>


      <p>
        I believe that it's time for the Church to go out of
        business.
      </p>


      <p class="bible">
        “We in the churches seem unable to rise above
        the fiscal philosophy which rules the business
        world; so we introduce into our church finances
        the psychology of the great secular institutions so
        familiar to us all and judge a church by its financial
        report much as we judge a bank or a department
        store.
      </p>

      <p class="bible">
        “A look into history will quickly convince any
        interested person that the true church has almost
        always suffered more from prosperity than from
        poverty. Her times of greatest spiritual power have
        usually coincided with her periods of indigence
        and rejection; with wealth came weakness and
        backsliding. If this cannot be explained, neither
        apparently can it be escaped.
      </p>


      <p class="bible">
        “The average church has so established itself
        organizationally and financially that God is simply
        not necessary to it. So entrenched is its authority
        and so stable are the religious habits of its
        members that God could withdraw Himself
        completely from it and it could run on for years on
        its own momentum.” - A.W. Tozer <a class="fn" href="footnotes.html#section-1-13-12">12</a>
      </p>


      <p>
        It’s time for us to begin to be the Church and not
        just attend one. I long for the day when we will turn our
        buildings into a home for runaway girls or forgotten
        seniors, or a sanctuary for children dying from cancer or
        AIDs.
      </p>


      <p>
        I long to break apart the asphalt parking lot and
        plow it under to grow affordable food for the families
        living in poverty downtown. I would love to find a way to
        use these resources for God's Kingdom and for the
        people He loves enough to die for instead of allowing it to
        sit empty between services.
      </p>


      <p>
        I believe that part of what Jesus was doing on the
        cross was to provide a quality of life for those who would
        follow after Him. That quality of life is connected to His
        vision for His Church.
      </p>


      <p>
        He died to create a people who would stop
        meeting in temples in order to be the living temple of
        God.
      </p>


      <p>
        He died to create a people who would stop
        submitting to the man-made authority of an earthly priest
        in order to become members of the Priesthood of
        Believers.
      </p>


      <p>
        He died to create a people who would stop
        offering a sacrifice for their sin and start living as
        sacrifices for the good of others – as loving servants who
        act as ambassadors of Christ and His Kingdom.
      </p>


      <p>
        Why would you trade God's vision of Church for
        the "sermon and a song" we've made it out to be?
      </p>


      <p>
        I pray that the Church would get out of the business of being a
        business and start being the Church that Jesus intended us to be all
        along.
      </p>
